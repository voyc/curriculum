======Scooters======

FYI, according to the US Department of Transportation, the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars.

motorcycle, motorbike, conventional motorcycle - feet on pegs, manual transmission

scooter, motor scooter - step-through design, with flat floorboard for feet, CVT automatic

kick scooter - standup design

moped - motor plus pedals

hard tail - a bike with no rear suspension, also called rigid.  Used in some Harley and Indian touring bikes.

sport motorcycle - Dropped handlebars, rear-set pegs, to allow the rider to tuck in for aerodynamic position.

cafe racer - a genre of sport motorcycles that originated among British motorcycle enthusiasts of the early 1960s in London. Standard production bikes that were modified by their owners and optimized for speed and handling for quick rides over short distances (from cafe to cafe).

  * acceleration: 0 to 60 kph in 7 seconds
  * max speed: 100 kph
  * range: 400 km (10 liter tank and 40 km per liter at 80 kph = 400 km in 5 hours)

  * saddle height: 760-780 mm
  * handlebar height: 1160 mm
  * torque: 10 Nm
  * wheelbase: 1250-1280 mm

Safety first.
  * Keep all tried and true design features of today's 125 cc petrol scooter.
  * form factor - conform to other motorist's expectations
  * UI - throttle, brakes, dashboard - require no additional learning to drive
  * acceleration - for superior maneuverability in traffic
  * brake lights, turn signals
  * mirrors
  * wheel size - for traction and stability on today's roads

Minimalist design.  No cladding.  No storage compartments.  No luggage rack.

Frame design decisions.
  * battery down low, to lower center of gravity, for stability of the ride
  * step-through design, with battery below the feet
    * ? ground clearance
    * heavy steel bottom
    * battery pack size, height
  * upright driver position - handlebars higher than the seat
  * two-person saddle
    * the bicycle post seat is rejected as uncomfortable

Dual hub motors.
  * dual motors has favorable cost-performance ratio over a single motor
  * a drive chain would apply only on the rear
  * eliminate cost, engineering, wear of a drive chain.
  * accept the additional wear on the rear motor due to road vibration

==== Frame ====

Must connect:
  * rear wheel with suspension and brakes
    * modern bikes use a double-sided swingarm, a single shock, and a linkage
  * battery
  * foot pegs
  * seat
  * front fork which must support:
    * wheel with suspension and brakes
    * steering
    * handlebars, with dashboard, throttle, brake handles, light switches
    * head lamp, turn signals, brakelights

  * steel
  * aluminum
  * carbon fiber
  * magnesium
  * titanium
  * composite


====Electronics====

Sensors
  * speedometer
  * tachometer
  * battery gauge
  * braking sensors
  * roll

bluetooth radio

Processor
  * connection to smartphone app
  * broadcast sensor data
  * receive and execute commands

====Motors====

Placement
  * mid motor with belt drive to rear wheel
  * hub motor on front wheel
  * hub motor rear wheel
  * dual hub motors, front and rear

Why use dual motors?
  * redundancy
  * traction
  * power
    * at low power, single motor is more efficient
    * at high power, dual motors can be more efficient

electronic free wheeling vs regenerative braking

Using only one of two motors makes no sense, because the idle motor drags.
Always share the load between multiple motors. 
If motors are unequal, split based on power ratio.

==Hookup==

One throttle, two controllers.

Use Y cable to split throttle signal.

==== Implementation Plan ====

  - Procure batteries, wheels with hub motors, speed controllers, throttle
  - Design and build a test frame to hold the wheels and put a load on them.
  - Design and build electronics
  - Design and program Android app
  - Get all the above working
  - Design frame
  - Fabricate frame (outsourced)
  - Procure remaining components - salvage a wrecked bike?
  - Assembly (outsourced)
  - Government registration

look for a wrecked Vespa or Filano or other step-through 125cc scooter

==== Chain Drive ====

Chain Drive Factors
  * cleaning
  * lubrication
  * tensioning


=== Chain Tension and Sprocket Distance ===

A hard-tail bike has no rear suspension, and the center-to-center distance between sprockets is fixed.  Most riders tension the chain with 13 mm slack.

On soft-tail bikes, the sprocket distance varies as the swing arm travels up and down.  The greatest distance occurs when the swing arm is level with the front sprocket.  The chain should be tensioned with 13 mm slack when the swing arm is at that level position.

What is the difference in sprocket distance due to swing arm travel?  Consider the following example.

{{ swing_arm_travel.png}}

In this diagram:
  * Point A is the pivot bolt.
  * Point B is the center of the rear sprocket.
  * Line AB represents the swing arm at level position, with a length of 500 mm.
  * Line AC represents the swing arm with 100 mm of travel upwards.
  * Point D is the center of the front sprocket, 100 mm in front of the pivot bolt.
  * Line DB represents the longest distance between sprockets at 600 mm.
  * Line segment DC represents the shorter distance between sprockets at 598.3 mm.

In this example, the difference in sprocket distance between level and upward positions is 1.72 mm.
(600 - 598.3 mm)

This means that if a rider were to tension his chain with the swing arm at the upward travel position, he would position the rear sprocket 1.72 mm too far to the rear, thus making the chain too tight at the level position.
