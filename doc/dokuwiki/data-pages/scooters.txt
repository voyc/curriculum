======Scooters======

FYI, according to the US Department of Transportation, the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars.[7]



Motorcycle = motorbike = conventional motorcycle = feet on pegs, manual transmission

scooter = motor scooter = step-through design, with flat floorboard for feet, CVT automatic

kick scooter = motorized scooter = standup design

moped = motor plus pedals

Essence:
  * Battery specs
  * Motor specs
  * Wheel size

max rpm * outside tire diameter = gives max speed

how to measure torque
 
Regenerative braking?  How implemented?

Comparison to petrol bikes
50, 110, 125 cc


1 hp = 746 W = .746 kW
1 hp = 15 cc (14 to 17 cc)
1 hp = 32 cc

1000 cc = 200 hp
1000 cc = 60 hp

==== Design Principles ====

Compatible with a 125 cc petrol scooter.
  * power: 12 hp, 9kw (746W = 1 hp)
  * acceleration: 0 to 60 kph in 7 seconds
  * max speed: 100 kph
  * range: 400 km (10 liter tank and 40 km per liter at 80 kph = 400 km in 5 hours)
  * tire size: 100/90-19 (100 mm width, 90% sidewall height = 90 mm, 19 inch rim diameter) 
  * suspension: front and rear
  * kerb weight: 150 kg
  * max load weight: 150 kg
  * passengers: driver plus one
  * price new: 3000 USD
  * ground clearance: 150-170 mm
  * saddle height: 760-780 mm
  * handlebar height: 1160 mm
  * torque: 10 Nm
  * wheelbase: 1250-1280 mm

Safety first.
  * Keep all tried and true design features of today's 125 cc petrol scooter.
  * form factor - conform to other motorist's expectations
  * UI - throttle, brakes, dashboard - require no additional learning to drive
  * acceleration - for superior maneuverability in traffic
  * brake lights, turn signals
  * mirrors
  * wheel size - for traction and stability on today's roads

Minimalist design.  No cladding.  No storage compartments.  No luggage rack.

Frame design decisions.
  * battery down low, to lower center of gravity, for stability of the ride
  * step-through design, with battery below the feet
    * ? ground clearance
    * heavy steel bottom
    * battery pack size, height
  * upright driver position - handlebars higher than the seat
  * two-person saddle
    * the bicycle post seat is rejected as uncomfortable

Dual hub motors.
  * dual motors has favorable cost-performance ratio over a single motor
  * a drive chain would apply only on the rear
  * eliminate cost, engineering, wear of a drive chain.
  * accept the additional wear on the rear motor due to road vibration

==== Frame ====

Must connect:
  * rear wheel with suspension and brakes
    * modern bikes use a double-sided swingarm, a single shock, and a linkage
  * battery
  * foot pegs
  * seat
  * front fork which must support:
    * wheel with suspension and brakes
    * steering
    * handlebars, with dashboard, throttle, brake handles, light switches
    * head lamp, turn signals, brakelights

Material:
  * steel
  * aluminum
  * carbon fiber
  * magnesium
  * titanium
  * composite


====Electronics====

Sensors
  * speedometer
  * tachometer
  * battery gauge
  * braking sensors
  * roll

bluetooth radio

Processor
  * connection to smartphone app
  * broadcast sensor data
  * receive and execute commands

====Motors====

Placement
  * mid motor with belt drive to rear wheel
  * hub motor on front wheel
  * hub motor rear wheel
  * dual hub motors, front and rear

Why use dual motors?
  * redundancy
  * traction
  * power
    * at low power, single motor is more efficient
    * at high power, dual motors can be more efficient

electronic free wheeling vs regenerative braking

Using only one of two motors makes no sense, because the idle motor drags.
Always share the load between multiple motors. 
If motors are unequal, split based on power ratio.

==Hookup==

One throttle, two controllers.

Use Y cable to split throttle signal.

==== Implementation Plan ====

  - Procure batteries, wheels with hub motors, speed controllers, throttle
  - Design and build a test frame to hold the wheels and put a load on them.
  - Design and build electronics
  - Design and program Android app
  - Get all the above working
  - Design frame
  - Fabricate frame (outsourced)
  - Procure remaining components - salvage a wrecked bike?
  - Assembly (outsourced)
  - Government registration

look for a wrecked Vespa or Filano or other step-through 125cc scooter
