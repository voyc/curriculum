== Equipment ==

  * porcelain crock with spigot, 4 liter or bigger
  * 4-liter cooking pot
  * 4-liter tea brewing jar
  * 4-liter kombucha brewing jar
  * cloths
  * large rubber bands
  * strainer
  * funnel
  * wooden spoon
  * bottles 300 ml with flip top cap (qty 10)
  * hydrometer

== Ingredients ==

  * starter scoby
  * starter kombucha
  * tea: black, green, oolong
  * sugar
  * ph strips

=== Sizes ===

Common bottle sizes:

  * Standard wine bottle: 750ml
  * Grolsch: 450ml
  * Cha Mama: 300ml (my favorite)
  * Blue Diamond: 200ml  

Batch size:

  * 4-liter brew vessel,
  * less 20% for starter,
  * less 5% for scoby,
  * leaves 3-liters to bottle with each batch

80-20 Rule:

  * 80 percent new tea
  * 20 percent previous tea with scoby

3-liters is 3000ml / 300ml bottles = 10 bottles with each batch

According to the e-book, 1 quart finished product requires:

  * 1-1/2 teaspoon loose tea, or 2 tea bags
  * 1/4 cup sugar
  * 2-1/2 cups water
  * 1/2 cup starter

Assume 1 liter is approximately 1 quart.

Then for 3-liters of brewed tea, we need:

  * 4-1/2 teaspoon loose tea, or 6 tea bags
  * 3/4 cup sugar

My kettle takes 4:28 minutes to boil 1 liter of water.

== Hygiene ==

Wash equipment and hands with soap and water or vinegar.

No:
  * no competing bacteria
  * no soap
  * no food residue
  * no bleach
  * no tea flakes in with the scoby (strain tea well)

Keep brewing operation away from fruit storage, kefir fermenting project, sprouting, plants, etc.

== Procedure ==

=== Make tea ===

  * Bring 3 liters of water to boil
  * Dissolve sugar first
  * Add tea
  * Let steep for 10 minutes, or longer
  * Strain into brewing jar
  * Let cool to room temperature, all day

=== Ferment 1 ===

  * add starter and scoby
  * put away to ferment, 5 to 30 days, between 70 and 80 degrees F
  * after 5 days, taste test every day.  Use straw as pipette to draw sample.
  * notes
  *   * Carbon dioxide is formed, but cover is not air-tight.
  *   * If cover was tight, scoby could be harmed.

=== Bottle ===

  * Move starter and scoby out to new batch of cooled tea
  * Kombucha is drinkable at this point
  * Strain out the brown yeast bits
  * add flavor (use 3rd brew jar for straining and flavoring)
  * pour into small bottles

=== Ferment 2 ===

  * let bottles sit at room temperature to let carbonation build up, two to 14 days
  * notes:
  *   * Fermentation continues but slower, without scoby and without oxygen.
  *   * Carbon dioxide is formed, and cover is airtight, so carbon dioxide builds up in bottle.
  *   * Adding fruit or juice adds sugar for more fermentation and more carbon dioxide.

=== Test ===

  * test ph: should be 2.5 to 4.0
  * test sugar and alcohol content

=== Finish ===

  *  move bottles to fridge
  *  notes:
  *   * Fermentation slows to almost nil.

== Adityan Comments ==

The first ferment is usually 3 to 4 days according  to your taste.  It should be just a little vinegary. Then you add the flavoring,  about 1/4 of the mixture should be flavoring.  The flavoring should be concentrated and strong in flavor,  add sugar til it tastes good and then just a little  more. You leave the mixture loosely covered 1 day.  Cover tightly 1 day.  Then you need to put it in the refrigerator or the lids will start blowing off!  Kaboomb!

If you let the kombucha go 7 days it would be too vinegary  and undrinkable.  My kombucha goes 3 at the max 4 days and it is very strong. I dont really flavor it anymore because I really like the taste just as it is.  I use 1 tablespoon Lapsang Schoosang tea + 2 tablespoons of some oolong Tea.  The lapsang give the kombucha a delicious smoky flavor.  I used this also in Pai.
