======The Handkerchief ======

The face-mask and social-distancing concepts are excessive and unsustainable, but they have served to remind us of the rules of civilized hygiene.
Carry a clean handkerchief at all times. If you need to cough, sneeze or yawn, cover your mouth and nose with the handkerchief.  Practice the quick draw.  Wash it after each use.
If you see another person coughing, sneezing or yawning in public, leave the area immediately.
If you are sick, stay home, quarantine yourself. Do not go to work. Do not go shopping. Do not go to restaurants. Do not ride public transportation.
Note. Do NOT sneeze into your elbow or sleeve.  That nonsense was posted on the WHO website for awhile.  Only an ignorant slob sneezes into his hand, arm, or shirt.

Note also. A tissue is fine for patting your lipstick, but it is too small and weak to handle a sneeze effectively, and it's too slow getting it out of the package.  Carry a clean handkerchief.

We could eliminate all colds and flus, including covid, from the planet, in three years.

We "could", if we wanted to.

How?

two rules

1. if you're sick, stay home

2. if you're well, use a handkerchief
