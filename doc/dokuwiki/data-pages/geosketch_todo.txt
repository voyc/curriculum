      * how do we select a shape for editing?
        * before saving, you can grab any point and move it
        * you can select any object on the page and begin editing it, moving points, close it if not already 
      * how do we select a layer for editing?
    * 4. save in base layer, restricted shape type
      * setting: allow base layer editing

  * custom layers
    * x put layer menu in local storage
    * new layer
    * attributes and data saved in database by userid
      * Public, private
      * Description, tags
      * custom palettes
    * Search engine

  * editable palette
    * consider base palette vs custom palette
    * KEEP data and presentation separate
    * data goes in database, palette in local storage.
        * custom layers require 1 palette for each layer
        * named palettes
    * put palette in local storage

  * save user data
    * save custom layers to db, svc writeLayer
    * read custom layers from db, svc readLayer
    * store palettes in db, svc writePalette
    * read palettes from db, svc readPalette
    * save localStorage in db

  * search, return list, select one, highlight selected, similar to hittest
    * find a place for the search button
    * multi-match
    * find "Kush", id 109
    * Names
      * Spelling
      * Add river, mountains, range, etc
      * Alternative names
      * Wiki link
      * Fewer cities
    * Alpha search index

Features
  * setup ctx ahead of time, not at draw time, after layer creation, "fixup layer palettes"
  * db update for editing base layers
  * db update for custom layers
  * cities and treasure layers with point medalions
  * Little x to close label, main menu, search results
  * North button, appears when gamma non-zero
  * time
    * add <<  >> fast forward
    * when touching mouse to date, resolve to slider

Bugs
  * when mouse moves off the board, blank out the whereami
  * pointInPolygon() does not always work, see Crystal Mountains
  * rank 1,2 gridlines hit only sometimes
    * seems to always work at intersection with other geoms
  * treat wheel zoom same as zoom slider
  * timepicker, arrow keys attempt string instead of numeric addition, until after first use of slider
  * timeslider appears on startup even when history layer is disabled

Mysteries
  * Big bang
  * DNA
  * Life only eats life. So the origin requires at least two life forms, or canabalism.
  * Civilization
  * Is there life without a cell?
  * Is there a life form that eats only inorganic minerals? Maybe some eat amino acids and proteins?

Chokepoints
  * Cumberland
  * Two horns, Africa, Arabia, straits
  * Capes, good hope, cod, 
  * Strait Malacca, piracy
  * Natural vs man-made, canal, bridge, turnpike, borders Crossing
  * Miles Davis twice
  * Berlin
