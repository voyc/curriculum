====== Mai Goals ======

Bring coach and student together and assist both.

Repetitive practice.

Introduce material to the student gradually, always reinforcing and building on what is already known.
  * Progressive drill.
  * Controlled vocabulary.  We know what words the user has mastered already, and we know the words in each story.

Use the story as a basic unit - instead of random vocabulary, or lessons - to make the learning engaging and purposeful.

We include songs, news stories and encyclopedia articles in the stories.
