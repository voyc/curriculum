====== Electricity ======

prerequisite: [[Electrochemical Reactions]]

Three most basic quantities of electricity are:
  * current
  * voltage
  * resistance

^ quantity     ^ measured in ^ description                ^
| current I    | amps A      | flow (volume) of electrons |
| voltage V    | volts V     | force, pressure, or load   |
| resistance R | ohms Ω      | resistance to the flow     |

These three quantities can be measured with a multimeter.

===== Ohm's Law =====

Ohm's Law defines the relationships among these three quantities.

\begin{align}
voltage &= current * resistance \\
V &= I * R \\
volts &= amps * ohms \\
V &= A * Ω \\
\end{align}

Examples:
  * For a motor with a given resistance, increasing the voltage will increase the current.
  * If you want to increase the current to the motor, increase the voltage.
  * If you choose a motor with a higher resistance, the voltage must be increased to achieve the same current.
  * As the resistance is increased, the voltage must be increase to maintain the same current.


=== Human body sensitivity to electricity ===

Internal resistance between the ears is 100 ohms.

From finger to toe, 500 ohms.

More resistance, more current.  

A current of 0.1 amp for 2 seconds can be fatal.

A human has been killed at as low as 42 volts.

Hanging on a wire vs touching the wire and the ground.

^ Current      ^ Reaction                                                  ^
| 1 mA         | Faint tingle.                                             |
| 5 mA         | Slight shock.  Disturbing.  Most people can let go.       |
| 6-30 mA      | Painful shock.  Loss of muscular control.                 |
| 50-150 mA    | Extreme pain.  Cannot let go.  Death is possible.         |
| 1000-4300 mA | Ventricular fibrillation. Nerve damage.  Death is likely. |
| 10,000 mA    | Cardiac arrest.  Severe burns.  Death is probable.        |

Wet skin - 1000 ohms

Dry skin - 500,000 ohms

Length of time.  1 tenth of an amp, 100 mA, for 2 seconds can be fatal.

The human body is an eletro-chemical-mechanical device.
A nerve is a kind of conductor.
Muscles contract in response to an electrical stimulus.



===== Current =====

current - flow of electric charge 

electric charge flows when there is voltage present across a conductor

current is measured in amps

current can also be measured as electrons per second

one electron has a charge of 1.602e-19

one ampere = one coulomb per second

one coulomb = 6.242e+18 electrons

one ampere =  6.242e+18 electrons per second

===== Voltage =====

voltage is the force or pressure that causes current to flow in a circuit

voltage is measured in volts

the resistance of a conductor is the opposition to the passage of a current through that conductor

electric charge flows when there is voltage present across a conductor

"voltage present across a conductor"

"flow in a circuit"

"electric charge"1 

===== Resistance =====

resistance is measured in ohms

voltage forces charge to flow in a conductor, resistance opposes that force
2
===== Power =====

A fourth quantity, power, measured in watts, is a combination of current and voltage.

\begin{align}
power &= voltage * current \\
P &= V * I \\
watts &= volts * amps \\
W &= V * A \\
\end{align}

Power is a combination of the force and speed of electrons.

A household lightbulb can be defined by wattage, because household current is a given.  In Europe and Asia it is 220VAC.

So a 60 watt light bulb will pull $60w / 220v = .27 amps$.

===== Capacitor, Inductor, Resistor =====

The three elementary electrical components:
  * capacitor
  * inductor
  * resistor

More:
  * transformer
  * relay
  * switch

==== Capacitor ====

A capacitor has two plates separated by a space.
{{https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/capatitors/100/electronic_component_capatitor-01-512.png?40}}

Each plate has area $A$.  The plates are separated by distance $d$.

Between the plates is a dielectric material (not to be confused with dialectic).

A dielectric material is an insulator that can be polarised by an electric field.  The electrons in the dielectric material cannot drift through the material, but they can shift slightly, causing dielectric polarisation.

The dialectic material has a dialectic constant $ε$.

Wires from a power supply are connected to the plates so that one is positive and the other is negative.

An electric field arises between the plates.

The electric field is measured in volts per meter $V / m$.

Electrical energy is stored in the field.

flux capacity

inductor, induce


==== Capacitance ====

The capacitance of a capacitor indicates how much charge the capacitor can store.

Capacitance is measured in farads (F) or microfarads (mF), named for Michael Faraday.


===== Inductance =====

An inductor is a coil.
{{ https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/electronic-components-1/100/electronic_component-33-512.png?40}}

The coil is wound around a core of dielectric material.

A linear coil is called a solenoidal inductor.

===== Frequency =====



===== Projects =====

===== Electricity vs Electronics =====

electrical circuit - controlled by mechanical switches

electronic circuit - controlled by electronic signals

===== Electrical Components =====

==== Wire =====

Wire can be distinguished by size and length.

There are three ways to denote the size of a wire.
  - by gauge, per American Wire Gauge (AWG). (bigger gauge : thinner wire)
  - by diameter, measured in mm
  - by cross-sectional area, measured in $mm^2$, used in EU countries

This wire size chart compares the three systems.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rTeLpV_CcZR8-DhbEExSx8_EGOr-80V_An1KQbldgYc/edit#gid=1590490442

Calculate cross-sectional area from diameter with this equation:
$$ A = \frac{D^2 * pi}{4}$$

For wires made of bundled strands, use the same equation but multiply by n numbers of strands.

==== Diode =====

Light Emitting Diode (LED)

==== Generator ====

Convert motive power into electrical power.

The first generators were built in the 1830's.

Several types:
  * dynamo - uses a commutator to flip the AC to DC, generating a pulsing DC current.
  * magneto - generates AC current using permanent magnets
  * alternator - generates AC current using field coils

==== Commutator ====

A metal ring split into two halves, with an electrode attached to each halve.
Used in motors and in generators.

==== Motor as Generator ====

Regenerative braking - Electric vehicles use the motor as a generator to recharge the battery.

===== Electronic Components =====

==== Transistor ====

replaced vacuum tube

Types of transistor:
  * field effect transistor (FET)
    * metal-oxide-semiconductor FET (MOSFET) - most widely used type
  * bipolar junction transistor (BJT)

====== Electromagnetism ======

  * mechanical linear
  * mechanical rotational
  * electrical 
  * magnetic

reluctance R = F / flux ϕ
It is sometimes known as Hopkinson's law and is analogous to Ohm's Law with resistance replaced by reluctance, voltage by MMF and current by magnetic flux.

permeance, the reciprocal of reluctance, P = 1/R

in electromagnetism, permeance is the inverse of reluctance

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_balancing
Battery balancing and battery redistribution refer to techniques that improve the available capacity of a battery pack with multiple cells (usually in series) and increase each cell's longevity.[1] A battery balancer or battery regulator is an electrical device in a battery pack that performs battery balancing.[2] Balancers are often found in lithium-ion battery packs for laptop computers, electrical vehicles. etc.

state of charge (SOC)

Balancing is only necessary for packs that contain more than one cell in series. 

Parallel cells will naturally balance since they are directly connected to each other, 

but groups of parallel wired cells, wired in series (parallel-series wiring) must be balanced between cell groups.

Inductor ac vs dc
https://www.homemade-circuits.com/inductors-in-acdc-circuits-explained/

induction = asynchronous
an induction motor can be used as a generator and vice-versa
an induction machine is both a generator and a motor
induction is for AC only
is induction always three-phase AC?
1. start with induction motor attached to the AC input line
2. apply a torque to the rotor to bring it up to match the speed of AC input line, the synchronous speed, current falls to zero
3. speed up the rotor past the synchronous speed, reverse current is generated

synchronous and induction generators are both alternators


https://www.homemade-circuits.com/inductors-in-acdc-circuits-explained/

inductors and capacitors are often used together. they are complementary.

inductor and capacitor and battery all store electric energy

inductor stores energy in the form of magnetic energy

inductor capacitor
inductor | initial energy stored | energy released after |
capacitor | energy stored gradually | when is energy released?

an inductor in AC == a resistor in DC

inductor 
in DC: behave and produce a short across inself
in AC: offer an opposing or restricting response, aka "choke"

suppressing high frequencies, suppressing surge currents, for bucking or boosting voltages

inductance: the property of opposiing instantaneous current 
reactance: the magnitude of this opposing force, proportional to frequence and current

made of coils or turns of wire

inductor - stores energy in a magnetic field
capacitor - stores energy in an electric field


https://electronicsphysics.com/faradays-law-of-electromagnetic-induction-for-emf/
this author uses the verb "induce" incorrectly

Oersted: current carrying wire produces magnetic field around it
Biot-Savart law, Ampere's circuital law, Fleming's right hand thumb rule, Maxwell's corkscrew rule

the reverse is also true

a current is induced in a conductor in a varying magnetic field 
Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction
induced EMF
electromotive force (EMF)
the EMF can drive a current

faraday law 1
Whenever a conductor is placed in a varying magnetic field, an electromotive force is induced. If the conductor circuit is closed, a current is induced, which is called induced current.
Note: the EMF is a potential.  The current is actual.

faraday law 2 - calculate the magnitude of the induced EMF
e = N × dΦ / dt

Lenz's Law
e = -N × dΦ / dt
Add minus sign.  The polarity of induced EMF is such that it would produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.
Φ =  change in magnetic flux
t = time
N = Number of turns
e = EMF


electromagnetic induction
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction
directly proportional to number of turns/coils in the conductor
variance.  moving the field or the conductor.  using AC. 

analogies	
Lenz's law may be seen as analogous to Newton's third law in classical mechanics[2][3] and Le Chatelier's principle in chemistry.[4]

three-phase induction motor - has three separated pairs of coils in the stator

The stator generates an RMF.

The shaft is connected to the rotor.

Squirrel cage rotor - Two end rings connected by some bars, resembling a hamster wheel.

The squirrel cage is effectively a set of wire loops.  The RMF generated by the stator induces a current in each of the wire loops of the squirrel cage.  The current in each wire loop generates a magnetic field. This magnetic field in the rotor interacts with the magnetic field in the stator resulting in rotation.

Induction, four types

electrostatic - a redistribution of electric charge in an object, caused by the influence of nearby charges

Electromagnetic induction - Current in a wire generates/produces/creates/induces a magnetic field around the wire.

Electric induction - a changing magnetic field induces a current in a nearby conductor.

Magnetic induction - is the process of magnetization of materials in an external magnetic field. (Same as electrostatic ?)


One of the four fundamental forces in the universe is the electromagnetic force. Not the electrical force or the magnetic force, but the electromagnetic force.

==== Direct Current (DC) ==== 

A battery has two terminals, positive and negative.
Between the two terminals is an electrolyte.

Chemistry.  A charged battery has a buildup of extra electrons at the negative terminal.

When a circuit is completed, the extra electrons flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal, until the two terminals are balanced, and the battery has lost its charge. 

=== Conventional, Positive, Wrong ===

When scientists first started working with electricity, they did not know about protons and electrons.

making batteries, 

| electron        | negative to positive | correct        | electronic engineers |
| positive charge | positive to negative | "conventional" | electrical engineers |

Electronic engineers say electric current is the flow of electrons from negative to positive.

Stubborn electrical engineers say current is the flow of a positive "space" from positive to negative.  They call this "conventional" current or positive current.  I call this wrong.

Conciliatory persons say there are two simultaneous currents: negative bits flow one way, and positive bits flow the opposite way.

Consider a queue of persons waiting in line for ice cream.  When the person at the counter is served he moves away leaving a space.  The next person in line moves forward to the space at the counter, leaving a space behind him.  The person behind him steps forward to fill the space.  And so on with each person back to the end of the line.

In this example, what is moving: the people, or the space?

some of the excuses I have heard.
  * Too hard to change now.  Like telling Americans to drive on the left, there would be chaos.
  * It doesn't matter mathematically in circuit analysis.  (not true for batteries, transistors and diodes)
  * There are two simultaneous and opposite circuits: the electrons flow from negative to positive, the positive charge flows from positive to negative.  (False) 

Ben Franklin is often blamed for the mixup, because he described positive and negative charges 50 years before the first battery, and 150 years before the electron was discovered.

He decided that the glass rod being rubbed with silk would be a positive charge while the rubber and fur would be a negative charge. So, with that convention, by removing electrons, the glass rod became positively charged and by adding electrons, the rubber rod became negatively charged.

Is that true?  Does the - terminal really have a superfluence of electrons?
annode, cathode

chemical reactions:
  * oxidation = loss of electrons
  * reduction = gain of electrons

anion - has gained an electron, negative charge
cation - has lost an electron, positive charge

cathode - reduction occurs,

electrons flow from anode to cathode, from oxidation half to reduction half
