====== The New Dark Age ======

First a quick overview of the original Dark Age.

The original Dark Age was 500 to 1500 CE.
It was brought about by the Christian priests.
The fall of Rome.
The armies called back to Rome.
All over Europe the priests and bishops were left alone without the armies to protect them and enforce their bullshit.
So to seize power, they deliberately plunged the world into the dark.
Burning books.
Not allowed to read the bible.  We will read it to you.


Now, its the business class that runs the world.  Primarily the oil industry.
And they are running scared, because people are getting wise.
