====== Online Education ======

What you can get by attending University:

  - knowledge and skills
  - the inspiration that can come from being around gifted professors and motivated fellow students
  - personal contacts that will be helpful in your future career

As for the first item, "knowledge and skills", you can get that online for free.

Educators are some of the most generous people.  Any of them could make more money working for a corporation, but they choose instead to devote their lives to helping people.
