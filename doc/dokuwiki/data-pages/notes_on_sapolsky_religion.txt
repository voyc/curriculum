Biological Underpinnings of Religiosity

==== Behavior ====

Sometimes a maladaptive gene can be good in some environments, bad in another.

Example: Sickle Cell Anemia, normally terrible, in some settings, sub-sahara Africa, can protect against malaria.

No such thing as a bad gene.  Only a bad gene-environment interaction.

Among Ashkenazim Jews, Tay-Sachs disease may protect against TB.  Case studies during WWII Eastern Europe.

Cystic Fibrosis full-blown, disastrous.  Partial, protected against cholera.

Full-blown version, bad.  Partial version, protective.

Schizophrenia

in the 1970s, Keddy, 1 Denmark study in Denmark, interviewed every family of every adoptee.
Schizotypol, a mild version
loose associations
social withdrawal, solitary occupation

metamagical thinking, science fiction, fantasy, new age, telepathy, UFO's, concrete interpretation of religiosity

1930s anthropology
half-crazy, shaman, witch doctor

hearing voices at the wrong time
at the right time

18:25

western society is equally irrational

"religion is organized schizophrenia"

Erwin Ackerknecht: "Our culture is unique in outlawing irrationality."

19:55

Gallup Poll of Americans
  * 25% believe in ghosts
  * 36% believe in mental telepathy
  * 47% believe in UFO's
  * 50% believe in the devil, and that the devil influences daily activities

27:06

social
motivation for good works
rituals

Beecher: religion is daily bread

29:05 

obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)

an anxiety disorder

example: tray of rice crispy treat

There's no insight.\\
It's not: "Help, there's something wrong with me.  I need to wash my hands six hours a day."
It's: "Help, there's something wrong with me.  I can never get clean."

38:45

religious leaders have sometimes been:
  * at the head of a crusade
  * has the most vivid description of hell and damnation
  * most fervent, most accomplished at doing the rituals

orthodox Brahmin
  * spend six hours per day in cleansing 
  * detailed rules on hand washing, swishing the mouth, how to lie down, what direction to face when defecating, when entering and leaving the temple, breathing, mouthfuls of food, 

orthodox Judaism:
  * very detailed rules involving food, prep, utensils
  * entering and leaving, touching, magic numbers

often magic numbers are so because they are easy to remember

numbers are more important than the content (everyone knows there are 10 commandments, but how many people can recite them all)

numerology

48:30

rituals built around
  * cleansing  the body
  * food preparation
  * entering and leaving significant places
  * numerology

same for religion and OCD

per Freud: 
  * OCD is an individual religiosity
  * religion is a universal compulsion

49:00
 
15th century, St Ignatius Loyola

scrupulosity = someone who is going through religious ritual for its own sake, not thinking about the content

in the talmud = cannot do it from memory, not by rote

in Islam = saying a prayer without thinking about the content, the prayers don't count

the ritual becomes more important than the content

a trait that is destructive in OCD, 
done in the right context becomes protective

assume a universal dread
the point of ritual is not to make the dread go away
but to share it and foster the community

55:00

Kafka: the hunger artist, a performance artist who starves himself.  there really were people who did this in the middle ages.

in modern times we think of a religious leader as someone who 
  * are empathic
  * make people treat each other better
  * comforts people during troubled times

but some of the time, a religious leader
  * is excellent at performing rituals

people can make a living performing rituals

16th century, Martin Luther, augustine monk, paralyzed by OCD, also had asshole father

1:04:00

who created these rituals?  OCD sufferers?

OCD sufferer:
  * can be really good at the rituals
  * can make money doing the rituals
  * maybe created the rituals in the first place

OCD has 1 to 10% in the population

1:08:10

religious people:
  * much lower incidence of depression
  * much longer life expectancy
  * less likely to drink to excess
  * fewer risk factors 

spirituality vs religion
  * spirituality is personal
  * religion is a group thing

?
  * control
  * predictability
  * explanation
  * outlet

1:09:26

correlates between patterns of behavior that we can explain and patterns of religious belief

superstitious behavior in pigeons.  experimentally giving random rewards of food.  The pigeon has a need to attribute.  The pigeon assumes whatever he just did resulted in the food appearing.  

why do we have a societal need for shamans?  because we are trying to explain he unexplainable. 

see cause and effect that may not be there

1:11:45

take rats, and damage their hippocampus

with hippocampal damage, you have more trouble making causal sequential links

rats with more hippocampal damage are more vulnerable to superstitious conditioning

difficulty telling the difference between causally related events, and events that have no connection

individual differences in number of hippocampal neurons, amount of enzymes, amount of myelin, means some people are more likely to be superstitious than others.  

(Note that this implies religiosity is a kind of brain disorder.)

1:13:04

epilepsy

epilectic seizures differ depending on the brain part where they originate

Temporal lobe epilepsy.  This particular form of epilepsy originates in the temporal lobe.  The temporal lobe contains the hippocampus, the amygdala, a big limbic area.

30 years ago, neurologist Geshwin at Harvard, described the Temporal Lobe Personality statistically correlated with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, but not absolutely.

Temporal Lobe Personality
  * extremely serious and humorless
  * neophobia, don't like new things
  * hypergraphia, begin to write obsessively
  * obsessively interested in religious and philosophical subjects.  Not becoming religious, but sincerely interested in the subject.

1:19:30

what I'm NOT saying
  * you gotta be crazy to be religious
  * most people who are, are psychiatrically suspect

It is fascinating that the same traits can be life-destroying in one setting.
And in a religious setting be sanctioned, valued, rewarded.
And there can be an underlying biology to this.
And what do we do with this?
