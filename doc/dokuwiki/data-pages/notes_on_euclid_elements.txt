Each proposition describes how to draw a geometric shape 
using only a straight-edge and a compass,

proving equality and inequality of lines and angles, 
without explicit measurement of either.

Each proposition builds on the ones before.

And therefore, each proposition is an axiom.



====Book 1.  Plane geometry.====  
2D shapes that lie in a single plane.  Polygons.\\

Proposition 1.1.  How to construct an equilateral triangle. 
  * Draw the base of the triangle as a line segment $\overline{AB}$.  
  * Use a compass to draw a circle with center $A$ and radius $B-A$.
  * Draw a second such circle with center $B$.
  * Take the point $C$ where the two circles intersect.
  * The triangle $ABC$ is equilateral.

Proposition 1.2.  How to draw two line segments of equal length.

Proposition 1.3.  Same as 1.2, alternate method.

Proposition 1.4  A proof that two triangles with two sides and the intervening angle equal,
are equal triangles.

Proposition 1.5  A proof that in an isosceles triangle, the two angles at the base 
are equal.

Proposition 1.6  A proof that in a triangle having two angles equal, 
the opposite sides will be equal also.

Proposition 1.7  A proof that for any three points, there is only one triangle.

Proposition 1.8  

Proposition 47.  A proof of the Pythagorean theorem.

====Book 2. Geometric algebra.====  
10 of the 14 propositions can be restated algebraically.
quadratic equations.

Proposition 1.  The distributive property of multiplication over addition.

\begin{align}
x(y_1+y_2+\cdots+y_n) = xy_1+xy_2+\cdots+x y_n\\
\end{align}

Euclid did not use the word "distributive", nor did he use this equation.\\
He told the story in terms of lines and rectangles. \\
x is the length of a line.  xy is the area of a rectangle.\\

Proposition 2. Same as prop 1, but only using 1 cut, two rectangles.

\begin{align}
x(y_1+y_2) = xy_1+xy_2\\
\end{align}

Proposition 3. 

\begin{align}
x = y + z \iff xy = y_2 + yz\\
\end{align}
