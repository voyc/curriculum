Who benefits from these beliefs?

If language has not evolved, per Chomsky, can the same be said for all aspects of human behavior?

Each proposition describes how to draw a geometric shape 
using only a straight-edge and a compass,

proving equality and inequality of lines and angles, 
without explicit measurement of either.

Each proposition builds on the ones before.

And therefore, each proposition is an axiom.

Proposition 1.1.  How to construct an equilateral triangle. 
  * Draw the base of the triangle as a line segment $\overline{AB}$.  
  * Use a compass to draw a circle with center $A$ and radius $B-A$.
  * Draw a second such circle with center $B$.
  * Take the point $C$ where the two circles intersect.
  * The triangle $ABC$ is equilateral.

Proposition 1.2.  How to draw two line segments of equal length.

Proposition 1.3.  Same as 1.2, alternate method.

Proposition 1.4  A proof that two triangles with two sides and the intervening angle equal,
are equal triangles.

Proposition 1.5  A proof that in an isosceles triangle, the two angles at the base 
are equal.

Proposition 1.6  A proof that in a triangle having two angles equal, 
the opposite sides will be equal also.

Proposition 1.7  A proof that for any three points, there is only one triangle.

Proposition 1.8  

Proposition 47.  A proof of the Pythagorean theorem.

====Book 2. Geometric algebra.====  
10 of the 14 propositions can be restated algebraically.
quadratic equations.

Proposition 1.  The distributive property of multiplication over addition.

\begin{align}
x(y_1+y_2+\cdots+y_n) = xy_1+xy_2+\cdots+x y_n\\
\end{align}

Euclid did not use the word "distributive", nor did he use this equation.\\
He told the story in terms of lines and rectangles. \\
x is the length of a line.  xy is the area of a rectangle.\\

Proposition 2. Same as prop 1, but only using 1 cut, two rectangles.

\begin{align}
x(y_1+y_2) = xy_1+xy_2\\
\end{align}

Proposition 3. 

\begin{align}
x = y + z \iff xy = y_2 + yz\\
\end{align}
