Masala means literally spice.  It refers to a type of spice mix used in India, especially in the south.

There are great variations in the mix of spices, but usually include:

  * cloves
  * cardamon
  * ginger
  * cinnamon
  * nutmeg (mace)
  * black peppercorns

A friend in Kerala told me anytime I see anything brown, it's probably a masala.

I've had
  * Masala Dosa
  * Masala Cookies
  * Masala Chicken
  * Masala Chai

A typical Indian version of garam masala contains nothing but:
  * Black and white peppercorns
  * Cloves
  * Cinnamon or cassia bark
  * Mace (Nutmeg)
  * Black and green cardamom pods
  * Bay leaf
  * Cumin

Optional additions:
  * nuts
  * onions
  * garlic

Preparation options:
  * Use powders and combine into a mix.
  * Use whole spices.  Smash and roast in oil at start of cooking.
  * Make paste with water, vinegar or coconut milk.
