====== Flash Game Theory ======

==== Pacing ====

A never-ending stream of cards is exhausting.  Break it into sets.  Give the user a completion, celebration, and rest before the next set.

==== Aural Reinforcement ====

Music.  Explosions.

==== Empathy ====

Note the user's speed and accuracy, compared to his average, and guess at his emotional state, or at least his levels of energy and focus.
