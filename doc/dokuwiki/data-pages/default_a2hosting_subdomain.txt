====== Default A2 Hosting Subdomain ======

===== Mod 1 =====

  * Make html the docroot, in cPanel Subdomains
  * delete cgi-bin folder (cgi scripts can run in any folder)
  * add a phpinfo.php script to the docroot
  * add a php.ini file to the docroot, to turn on logging to sandbox.log (Did not take effect until I viewed cPanel, Select PHP Version.)
  * add a dot htaccess file with a lsapi_phpini directive to apply php.ini to all folders
