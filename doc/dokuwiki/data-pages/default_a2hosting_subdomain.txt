====== Default A2 Hosting Subdomain ======

===== Mod 1 =====

  * Make html the docroot, in cPanel Subdomains
  * in the docroot
    * delete cgi-bin folder (cgi scripts can run in any folder)
    * add a phpinfo.php script to the docroot
    * add and modify a php.ini file, to turn on logging to xxxxx.log (Did not take effect until I viewed cPanel, Select PHP Version.)
    * add and modify a dot htaccess file with a lsapi_phpini directive to apply php.ini to all folders
  * also, add and modify a config.ini file to point the log file
