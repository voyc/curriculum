====== Genetics =====

gene

chromosome

DNA

RNA


==== gene expression ==== 

== transcription ==
- DNA in a gene is copied to produce an RNA transcript called messenger RNA (mRNA).  This is carred out by an enzyme called RNA polymerase which uses available bases from the nucleus of the cell to form the mRNA.

== translation ==

===== Gene Transfer =====

Gene transfer - the transfer of genetic information between organisms.  Can be vertical or horizontal.

Vertical gene transfer is better known as sexual reproduction, from parent to offspring.

Horizontal gene transfer is directly from one organism to another.

==== Sexual Reproduction ====

vertical gene transfer

translation




==== Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) ====

aka Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT) 

mechanisms
  * transformation
  * transduction
  * conjugation



===== Genetic Engineering =====

Gene delivery = artificial HGT
