====== Genetics ======

Three branches:
  * Molecular Genetics - molecules of gene, DNA, RNA, protein
  * Mendelian Genetics aka Transmission Genetics - how traits are passed to offspring
  * Population Genetics - how variation of trains in a population can lead to evolution

These three branches can be studied in three contexts:
  * Bacteria
  * Archaea
  * Eukaryotes

Likewise, in the context of
  * Evolution
  * Deisease and health
  * Society

Course concept:
  * Flipped Classroom
  * Team Based Learning

gene

chromosome

DNA

RNA

Central Dogma: DNA is transcribed into mRNA.  mRNA is translated into protein (trait).
The protein can be thought of as a trait.  This is a general guideline.  There are variations in different cases.

DNA       ->         RNA      ->        protein
     Transcription       Translation

$$ \text{DNA} \rightarrow \text{mRNA} \rightarrow \text{protein} $$

$$ \ce{DNA -> mRNA -> protein} $$

DNA is drawn as a double helix.

Gene is a piece of the DNA chain.

Gene Glut2 -> protein Glut2

Glut2 protein is a receptor on the outside of a cell that brings glucose into the cell.

genetic variation = differences in inherited traits found in individuals in a population

example: Glut2 mutation where glucose enters the cell less efficiently.  This mutation is associated with Diabetes Type II.
     
Genotype ->  -> Phenotype


==== gene expression ==== 

== transcription ==
- DNA in a gene is copied to produce an RNA transcript called messenger RNA (mRNA).  This is carred out by an enzyme called RNA polymerase which uses available bases from the nucleus of the cell to form the mRNA.

== translation == 

===== Gene Transfer =====

Gene transfer - the transfer of genetic information between organisms.  Can be vertical or horizontal.

Vertical gene transfer is better known as sexual reproduction, from parent to offspring.

Horizontal gene transfer is directly from one organism to another.

==== Sexual Reproduction ====

vertical gene transfer

translation




==== Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) ====

aka Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT) 

mechanisms
  * transformation
  * transduction
  * conjugation



===== Genetic Engineering =====

Gene delivery = artificial HGT

===== Notes =====

The cell nucleus contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, 22 non-sexual, 21 sexual. One chromosome is a long strand of DNA. DNA is a protein. A section of DNA is named a gene. A gene defines a trait.
 
The human body is made of proteins. Types of proteins:
Membrane 
DNA 
 
One DNA molecule IE 1 chromosome contains billions of atoms arranged in pairs.one DNA molecule contains hundreds or thousands of genes.
New line 
Gene expression
The gene causes a protein molecule to be created.

We want to understand intelligence. Intelligence is related to thought. our best guess is that intelligence and thought are functions of the brain. To understand the brain we study neurology and psychology. Neurology requires an understanding of neurotransmitters and hormones which are proteins. To understand proteins we must and understand basic chemistry, how atoms combine to molecules. A protein is a molecule.
 
Furthermore one aspect of AI is named genetic algorithms. to understand these algorithms we need and understanding of genetics.
