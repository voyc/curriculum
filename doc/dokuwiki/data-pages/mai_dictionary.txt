====== Mai dictionary ======

two tables, dict and mean, joined by dict.id = mean.did
  * dict contains the thai word
  * mean contains one or more english translations for each thai word

dict.g is type
  * o - one syllable word or syllable
  * m - multi-syllable word
  * s - symbol, ie, ๆ

pos Part of Speech, included in mean table
  * n noun
  * v verb
  * c conjunction
  * p preposition
  * j adjective
  * e adverb
  * r pronoun
  * a particle
  * i interjection
  * s syllable - note: this is not a part of speech

One meaning can have multiple pos.

==== pm parse manual ====
  * cp, ru, tl have been manually edited by the user, because the parser failed
  * click the pm checkbox in the editor to open these fields to editing
  * replaces and combines tlm and cpm
  * Note: pm = true indicates the parser failed. this field must be updated when the parser succeeds

==== pf parse fixed (y/n) ====
  * the record cannot be re-parsed
  * cp, ru, tl cannot be changed by a user
  * the testsuite is built dynamically selecting these records from the dict
  * when we train an AI to do parsing, these records become the training set
  * Note: when pf = true, pm may be true or false

==== search special ====
in addition to search exact and search partial:
  * find words which have some known glyphs (replacing Noam::collect())
  * find words which have only known glyphs
  * pf = true/false
  * pm = true/false
  * lc = ก
  * lc.length > 1
  * lc includes ก
  * ditto fc, tm, t
  * includes rule
  * type = m/o/s

options
  * include only known words
  * include only new words

implement via sql or dictionary iterate

==== ToDo ====
  * rewrite translate()
  * rewrite translit()
  * rewrite iterate()
  * repurpose tlm/cpm to pm/pf (see above)
  * implement search special (see above)
