====== Lines of Force ======

Faraday, Maxwell, Einstein

field, force, wave, particle

shape, pattern of force field

energy to matter, simple to complex

attraction, repulsion

Faraday coined the term //lines of force//. \\
Maxwell used the term //tubes of force// and compared electromagnetic force to fluid dynamics.

=== python, blender ===

blender force fields: force, charge, magnetic, harmonic, collision, gravity 

Particles, two types: hair and emission.

===== Torus =====

torus - a geometry surface generated by revolving a circle about an axis, 
creating a donut-shaped tube.

parts of a torus:
  * tube
  * central void
  * axis of revolution
  * circle, revolved around the axis, creating the tube

a torus is defined by two radii:
  * $R =$ the major radius, from the axis to the center of the circle
  * $r =$ the minor radius, the radius of the circle

types of torus, based on the aspect ratio between the two radii:
  * $R > r =>$ torus of revolution - normal donut shape, axis does not touch the circle
  * $R = r =>$ horn torus - axis is tangent to the circle
  * $R < r =>$ spindle torus - self-intersecting, axis passes twice through the circle

  * poloidal direction, red arrow, toward the poles, ring around the surface
  * toroidal direction, blue arrow, parallel to lines of latitude

Note that:
  * $R+r =$ radius of the outer rim of the tube 
  * $R-r =$ radius the inner rim of the tube

==== Torus Spiral ====

There are two ways to draw a spiral on the surface of a torus.

  - poloidal winding, a cylindrical helix drawn around the tube
  - toroidal winding, a closed helical trajectory drawn perpendicular to the axis
