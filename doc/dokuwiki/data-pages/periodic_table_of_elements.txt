====== Periodic Table of Elements ======

back to [[Chemistry]]

The basic building block of matter is the **atom**.

There are 118 types of atoms.  Each of these types is called an **element**.

The elements are organized into a table of 7 rows and 18 columns.  Each row is considered a period, and therefore we call this table the **Periodic Table** of the elements.

Identifiers for each element
  * atomic number - the number of protons in one atom of this element
  * symbol - a one or two-letter abbreviation of the name
  * name - the name of the element
  * atomic weight - the average weight of an atom of this element

table structure
  * 7 rows
  * 18 columns

Example: Hydrogen
  * Position: row 1, column 1
  * Atomic number: 1.  That means the atom has one proton.
  * symbol: H
  * name: Hydrogen
  * weight: 1.008


Atoms are made of **protons**, **neutrons**, and **electrons**.
