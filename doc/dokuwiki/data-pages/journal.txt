Purchase mini traffic cones from lazada.  Red.

29 Jun \\
Take photos of a red traffic cones from different angles. Using Android phone.

30 Jun \\
Upload photos to Google Drive folder \\
/My\ Drive/sync/skateboard/images/cones/raw

1 Jul \\
create skateboard.ipynb for use with Google Colab \\
example https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/train-yolo-v3-to-detect-custom-objects-with-free-gpu-d8d0262100fe

2 Jul \\
Image processing.  Scale down. \\
$ python3 prepimage.py \\
output into folder: \\
/My\ Drive/sync/skateboard/images/cones/train

Image labeling.  There are several labeling programs.  I used a free online service, 
https://www.makesense.ai/ \\
one file named classes.name \\
one .txt file for each .jpg file \\
output into same folder with the images: \\
/My\ Drive/sync/skateboard/images/cones/train \\
one row for each detected object \\
5 fields per row:
  * index into label list in file classes.name, we use only one label: cone, index 0
  * x normalized as percentage of width
  * y (top to bottom) normalized as percentage of height
  * w normalized as percentage of width
  * h normalized as percentage of height

13 Jul \\
Received Tello drone. \\
Had to do three things to get it to hover.
  - Calibrate.
  - Turn off the AC.
  - Lay a patterned sheet down on the floor.

Tried two apps.
  - Tello.  official app from DJI/Ryze.
  - TelloMe.  from volate!lo.  Like Tello plus FollowMe capability.  volate!lo also makes TelloFPV, which I will not try.

16 jul \\
Flew Tello outside \\
TelloMe does not do orbit and follow at the same time. \\
Video drops frames with increased distanced. \\

31 Jul \\
I've been running programs driving the Tello, testing sockets, and using OpenCV. \\
Today, I got an error Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module" \\
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "color.py", line 118, in <module>
  img = cv2.imread(coneimg, CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR);
  NameError: name 'CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR' is not defined

I ran  \\
`sudo apt-get install python-opencv` \\
and now `import cv2` says \\
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2' \\

`pip install opencv-python` says \\
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement opencv-python (from versions: none) \\
ERROR: No matching distribution found for opencv-python \\

Why would I use pip vs apt-get? \\

I ran  \\
`sudo apt-get remove python-opencv` \\
`sudo apt-get purge python-opencv` \\
still no module named 'cv2' \\

Corrected using `sudo apt-get install python3-opencv` \\
It installed version 3.2.  Don't know how to get 3.3.1. \\
