====== Draft ======

this page is file draft/index.txt

draft is the namespace (folder)

every link on this page is automatically assumed to be within the draft namespace

  [[index]]\\
  [[todo]]\\
  [[China Expansion]]\\
  [[What is a prostitute?]]\\
  [[CIA Puppets]]\\

To link to these pages from outside, we include the namespace in the link

  [[draft:index]]\\
  [[draft:todo]]\\
  [[draft:China Expansion]]\\
  [[draft:What is a prostitute?]]\\
  [[draft:CIA Puppets]]\\

Should we include the namespace on the page titles ?

CIA Expansion\\
or \\
Draft: CIA Expansion\\

answer: no. This implies we can eventually publish the page without changing the title.

[[index]]\\
[[todo]]\\
[[China Expansion]]\\
[[What is a prostitute?]]\\
[[CIA Puppets]]\\
