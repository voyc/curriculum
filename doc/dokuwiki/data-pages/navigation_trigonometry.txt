=== route ===
a series of lines and arcs between points on a map

=== point ===
can be defined relative to a center point in two ways:
  * by cartesian coordiates: x,y
  * by polar coordinates: theta, radius

=== line ===
line can be represented in two ways:
  + by two points
  + by starting point, heading, and length

an arc can be represented as:
  * two thetas, radius, direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise)

===== Drop a Triangle =====

Example navigation problem: **given a line AB, find the heading and length of the line**

Solution:

Add point C to make a right triangle ABC, such that
  * point C is the right angle c
  * line AB is the hypotenuse
  * angle a at point A is parallel to the x-axis, with length dx from point C
  * angle b at point B is parallel to the y-axis, with length dy from point C

From the two points A,B, we know:
  * angle c = 90 degrees
  * dx = xB - xA, horizontal vector, length of the adjacent side
  * dy = yB - yA, vertical vector, length of the opposite side
  * slope of AB = dy/dx, the ratio of vertical over horizontal

Now using the equations below we can calculate the remaining factors:
  * length of AB = square root of (dx squared + dy squared) # pythagorean theorem
  * angle a = arcsin(dy / AB)   # inverse trigonometry functions
  * angle b = arccos(dx / AB) 

===== Trigonometry Functions =====

The primary functions return the ratio of the sides, per "soh cah toa".
  * sin(a) = opp/hyp
  * cos(a) = adj/hyp
  * tan(a) = opp/adj

The inverse functions return the angle, given the ratio of the two sides. 
  * a = arcsin(opp/hyp)
  * a = arccos(adj/hyp)
  * a = arctan(opp/adj)

===== Pythagorean Theorem =====

        sq(dx) + sq(dy) = sq(hyp)  

===== Law of Sines =====

The ratios of each side over the sine of its opposing angle are equal.

                opp(a)/sin(a) = opp(b)/sin(b)  = opp(c)/sin(c)

        Heading - direction the vehicle is pointing
        Course - direction the vehicle is moving, may be different from heading due to drift
        Bearing - direction to destination or navigational aid
        Relative bearing - angle between heading and bearing

        angle - the angle within the right triangle, always < 90 degrees (in radians)
        theta - the obtuse angle indicating direction within the circle (in radians)

===== Units Conventions =====
  radians - 2pi to a circle, oriented at 3 o'clock
  compass degrees - 360 to a circle, oriented to 12 o'clock

  heading, course and bearing are given in compass degrees
  relative bearing is given in degrees
  angle and theta are given in radians

  an inverse function undoes the function
  arctangent is the inverse of tangent

  ratio = tan(angle)      # tangent takes an angle and returns a ratio 
  angle = arctan(ratio)   # arctangent takes the ratio and returns the angle
  slope = tan(theta)      # toa, ratio of opposite to adjacent, y/x, slope      
  theta = arctan(slope)   # inverse of tangent, get the angle theta from the slope  
  
  slope does not distinguish between lines going up or down
  positive slope indicates a direct relationship between x and y
  negative slope indicates an inverse relationship between x and y
  negative change in y means line is going down, else up 
  negative change in x means line is going left, else right

  theta does distinguish between lines going up or down
  theta is an obtuse angle between 0 and 2pi
  theta between 0 and pi indicates the line is going up
  theta between pi and 2pi indicates the line is going down

  . -dy, -dx => +slope, down to the left , quadrant 3 ll
  . +dy, +dx => +slope, up   to the right, quadrant 1 ur
  . -dy, +dx => -slope, down to the right, quadrant 4 lr
  . +dy, -dx => -slope, up   to the left , quadrant 2 ul

  theta should always be positive
  arctan(negative slope) returns a negative theta

  as slope approaches vertical from the right it approaches infinity
  as slope approaches vertical from the left it approaches -infinity

  an angle can be expressed as radians or degrees
  let angle refer to the angle within a right triangle, always < 90 degrees or pi/2
  let theta refer to the obtuse angle relative to the right-side x axis

  slope = ratio dy/dx = tan(angle)   # tan() returns a ratio
  angle = arctan(dy/dx)              # arctan() returns an angle in radians

  . -90 degrees < angle < +90 degrees 
  .  -1.57 rads < angle < +1.57 rads      # pi/2 = 1.57

  if dy/dx is negative, arctan(dy/dx) is negative (in quadrants 2 and 4)

  Summary
        slope -> angle -> theta -> heading

  sides -> ratio -> angle -> theta -> heading
  dx,dy -> dy/dx -> arctan() -> theta -> heading
  sides = dx,dy
  ratio = dy/dx
  angle = arctan(ratio)
  theta = thetaFromAngle(angle,dx,dy)
  heading = headingFromTheta(theta)

  given a line AB
  where
    slope is the ratio of dx,dy,  between -inf and +inf
    angle is the angle of our line to the x-axis, between -pi/2 and +pi/2 in radians
    theta is between +=2pi radians, oriented to horizontal axis pointing right
    heading is between 0-360 degrees, oriented to straight up north
    quadrant is 1,2,3, or 4

===== Cartesian vs Polar Coordinates =====
        cartesian coordinate point: x,y
        polar coordinate point: center, theta, radius

polar coordinates

        as if, looking at a globe at the north pole

        picture a globe
        rotatated so that you are looking down on the north pole
        the prime meridian is on the right, and the international dateline is on the left
        that means the meridians are going counter-clockwise from 0 to 180
        if you go counterclockwise, the meridians are -1 to -180

        therefore, 
        theta is always positive
        angle can be negative or positive
        theta originates at the positive x-axis
        angle originates at the x-axis, either negative or positive
        angle is relative to the quadrant
        theta is relative to the whole circle

        to calculate 
        drawing counter-clockwise, the angle will be negative 
        draw from 40 degrees to -o
        a point can be positioned 
        
        a line between two points can only be drawn one way
        an arc between two points can be drawn two ways: cw and ccw
        
        wise = cw
        wise = ccw
        cw = -1
        ccw = 1

        A, B, center, radius, wise
        A, B, thetaA, thetaB, center, radius, wise

        can you calculate a center from two points?
                yes if you know the radius
        can you calculate the radius?
                yes if you know the center
        it would be the point where the lengths are equal
        and there would be two possible points
        

if dx is 0, we don't know if the line is going up or down
options
        look at the last known heading
        don't allow identical x values in the cones array
                also scan left and right values for match

===== Angle vs Theta =====
        both are given in radians 
        theta indicates direction, angle does not
        in fact, angle can indicate one of four thetas, depending on quadrant
        the signs of dx,dy are required to determine quadrant
https://socratic.org/questions/how-do-you-convert-3-4-into-polar-coordinates

===== Heading vs Theta =====
        heading and theta both indicate direction within a circle

        heading is given in compass degrees, 0 to 360, clockwise
        theta is given in radians, 0 to 2pi, counter-clockwise
        
        theta is used in the matplotlib Arc() function
        heading is used by humans

        conversion functions:
                theta = thetaFromHeading(heading)
                heading = headingFromTheta(theta)

line AB has slope, length, heading
