Inflammation causes a hole in the gut.

Gluten, casein (a protein), heavy metals leak out and circulate thru the body.

This causes
  * Thyroid condition
  * Joint pain, arthritis
  * Autoimmune issues

Leads to
  * Food intolerance
  * Inflammation of immune abnormalities
  * Autoimmune disease

A big cause of Leaky Gut is prescription antibiotics, because they upset the balance of healthy microbes in the gut.

So the solution includes eating [[Probiotics]].
