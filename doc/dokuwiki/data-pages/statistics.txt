===== Distribution =====

median, range, IQR

box-and-whisker plot


box plot vs dot plot



===== Frequency Distribution =====

dot plot

mean absolute deviation (MAD)




central tendancy
  * mean, aka arithmetic mean, $\mu$ = average
  * median = middle number of rank ordered set
  * mode = most frequent number

spread
  * range = max - min
  * interquartile range (IQR) = diff between top half median and bottom half median
  * variance, sigma squared, $\sigma^2$ = $\frac{\sum_{x=1}^{N}(x_i-\mu)^2}{N}$ 
  * standard deviation, sigma, $\sigma$ = $\sqrt{\sigma^2}$

with a tight distribution, mean and standard deviation work best

with a skewed distribution, median and interquartile range work best


do algebra on the variance formula


\begin{align}
\mu &= \frac{\sum_{x=1}^{N}(x_i)}{N} &&\text{mean formula}\\

\sigma^2 &= \frac{\sum_{x=1}^{N}(x_i-\mu)^2}{N} &&\text{variance formula 1}\\

\sigma^2 &= \frac{\sum_{x=1}^{N}(x_i)^2}{N} - \mu^2  &&\text{variance formula 2}\\

\sigma^2 &= \frac{\sum_{x=1}^{N}(x_i)^2}{N} - \frac{\left [\sum_{x=1}^{N}(x_i)\right ]^2}{N^2}  &&\text{variance formula 3}\\
\end{align}


=== Population vs Sample ===

We can work with an entire population.\\
Or we can work with a sample from the population.\\
The math is the same except for two things.

  - The symbols are different.
    * For a population, we use 
      * $\mu$ for the mean, 
      * $\sigma$ for standard deviation, and 
      * $N$ for the number of points.
    * For a sample, we use 
      * $\bar{x}$ for the mean, 
      * $s_x$ for standard deviation, and
      * $n$ for the number of points.
  - The divisor in the standard deviation formula is different.
    * For a population, we divide by N.
    * For a sample, we divide by n-1.

==== Relative Frequency ====

y axis is percent instead of raw frequency count


==== Density Curve ====

Make histogram bars more and more narrow until the top becomes a line.

The data points can take on any value in a continuum, 
as opposed to being lumped into coarse buckets.

Area under the curve is 100%.

The curve will never go negative.

Measure the area under the density curve between two values,
to get the percentage of data points falling between those two values.
This can sometimes be estimated by calculating the area of the rectangle.

You cannot calculate the percent of a single value, 
because there is no rectangle.
The line has no width.


=== Symmetric Density Curve ===

mean and median are equal, both cut the area under the curve in half

in the bell curve, the mode is also equal to the mean and median

picture a bimodal symmetric curve

the area under the left half is equal to the area under the right half

=== asymmetric density curve ===

aka skewed

mean will be towards the long tail from the median

long tail to the right => right-skewed distribution

and vice versa

==== Binomial Distribution ====

uses factorial in the formula

is discreet function

each trial has boolean result, ie, success or failure


===== Distribution =====

Look at past events and organize them into patterns which tell a story and 
allow us to understand how, when, and why things happen.

The graph of a distribution is a curve.

There are several kinds of distributions.

discrete vs continuous



distributions
  * linear growth, errors, offsets
    * normal, Gaussian
  * exponential growth, prices, incomes, populations
    * log-normal, a single quantity whose log is normally distributed
    * Pareto, a single quantity whose log is exponentially distributed
  * uniformly distributed
    * discrete uniform distribution, for a finite set of values, coin, die
    * continuous uniform distribution, for continously distributed values
  * Bernoulli trials
    * Bernoulli distribution (success/failure, yes/no)
    * Binomial distribution, ?
    * negative binomial distribution, 
    * geometric distribution, number of failures before the first success
  * categorical outcomes (events with K possible outcomes)
  * Poisson process (events that occur independently with a given rate)
  * absolute values of vectors with normally distributed components
  * normally distributed quantities opereated with sum of squares
  * as conjugate prior distribution in Bayesian inference
  * some specialized applications
  * 

Naive Bayes Classifier in AI is based on Bayes' Theorem in probability theory.

===== Normal Distribution =====

aka Bell Curve or Gauss Distribution.


==== Bell Curve ====
{{ ::bell_curve.png|}}

The _normal distribution_ is given by the equation
$$e^{\frac{-x^2}{2}}$$

When we actually have input data, we will use this equation.
$$y = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt[]{2\pi }}e^{\frac{(x-\mu )^2}{2\sigma ^2}}$$

Characteristics:
  * The curve is symmetric about the y axis.
  * The center portion is a convex parabola and has one maximum point.
  * To either side lies an inflection point where the line becomes a concave parabola.
  * The line stretches to the left and right, approaching the limit of zero.
  * The area under the curve totals 1.0, the total probability of any prediction.


==== Median ====
==== Standard Deviation ====


Salmon Khan uses problems from ck12.org open source flex book: AP Statistics

Empirical Rule:  68 - 95 - 99.7
  * Values within plus-or-minus 1 standard deviation account for 68% of the universe.
  * Values within plus-or-minus 2 standard deviation account for 95% of the universe.
  * Values within plus-or-minus 3 standard deviation account for 99.7% of the universe.

==== Standard Normal Distribution ====

a distribution where

$$\mu = 0 \text{ and } \sigma = 1$$

z-score = number of standard deviations away from the mean

$$ \text{z-score} = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

allows comparison of values on different scales and distributions, like LSAT and MCAT

Standard Normal Table, aka z-table - a table based on the Standard Normal Distribution

gives cumulative probability for any z-score

where cumulative probability is the area under the curve to the left of the z-score

How to find the cumulative probability of a value in the distribution. 
  * Calculate the z-score
  * Look up the z-score in the standard normal table

===== Normal vs Pareto =====

Walter Scheidel: The Great Leveler
https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691183251/the-great-leveler
the only things that can level wealth inequality are:
war
revolution
state collapse
plague

nomal
iq
conscientiousness
openness

pareto
productivity
creative output

Price's Law
Derek De Sola Price
1960s study: a vanishingly small proportion of scientests operating in a given domain, produce half the output
a tiny number of people produce almost all of everything
aka square root law 
The square root of a number of people in a domain produce half the output
if you have 10 employees, 3 of them produce half the output
if you have 100 employees, 10 of them produce half the output
if you have 10,000 employees, 100 of them produce half the output

The Matthew Principle
From those who have everything, more will be given.
From those who have nothing, all will be taken.
(An economic principle, copying language from the new testament.)

iq, conscientiousness, openness are normally distributed and are good predictors of long-term performance
but creative output is NOT normally distributed

The SAT, GRE, the LSAT, all of those are IQ tests.
They are more crystallized than fluid.

IQ 
145 to 160 - to be the best.  1 in 10,000
116 to 130  - 95-86 percentile
115-110 - 85-73 percentile
below 87 - no jobs
below 83 -  10% of pop. , cannot join the army
