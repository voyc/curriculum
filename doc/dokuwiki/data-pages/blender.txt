======Blender======

Blender contains a:

  * 3D Modeler, and a
  * Video Sequence Editor (VSE)

3D models can be used in three applications:
  - fabricating and manufacturing
  - video games
  - animation for film and video

This later use requires video editing, and therefore, the Video Editing capabilities
were added into Blender, and integrated with the 3D modeling.

===== Structure =====

The blend file is a database.  

It contains objects and scenes and collections.

Each object is referenced into one or more collections.

Each scene has a collection.

The user can also create collections for his own organizational purposes.

Collections can be named, colored, and nested hierarchically.

A collection can be appended or linked from another blend file.



===== UI =====

The Blender window is divided into three parts:
  - Topbar - one line at the top containing menus.
  - Current Workspace - the large space between the Topbar and the Status Bar.
  - Status Bar - one line at the bottom containing status info.

The Status Bar is optional.  It can be turned off via the Window menu.

Keyboard shortcut cheatsheet:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByidsAQcVcUUei0wc1lpVWlfUFU


==== Top Bar ====

The Topbar contains four menus.

  - main menu - App, File, Edit, Render, Window, Help
  - workspace tabs - one tab for each open workspace and a plus-sign Add Workspace button.
  - Scene menu - a drop-down menu of scenes, plus New and Delete buttons
  - View Layer menu - a drop-down menu of view layers, plus New and Delete buttons

There is always at least one workspace tab, one Scene, and one View Layer.

==== Visible UI Elements ====

workspace, area, editor, panel, tab

A **workspace** occupies the window space between the Topbar and the Status Bar.

A workspace is divided into one or more rectangular **area**s.

Each area contains one **editor**.

Some editors contain one or more **panel**s.

Groups of panels can be toggled into view via **tabs**.

=== Workspace ===

There is always one **current workspace** visible.
Choose among the open workspaces by clicking on its tab in the Topbar.

A **default workspace** is a named layout of areas.
There are 22 default workspaces divided into 5 categories.
Nine of these are open by default when you start Blender.

To close a workspace, right-click on its tab and select Delete.

To open a workspace, click on the Add Workspace (plus-sign) button in the Topbar,
and then choose from among the default workspaces listed in the menu.

[Note: When Blender says add and delete workspace, they really mean open or close.]

To create a **custom workspace**, right-click on any tab and select Duplicate.
Then double-click the new tab and rename it.

A custom workspace is saved in the blend file.  To make it globally available, click File - Defaults - Save Startup File.  This will create a startup.blend file in a new folder named for the workspace in the user's config.

  ./config/blender/2.82/config/Video_Editing/startup.blend

=== Area === 

An area is a rectangular area of the workspace.

Areas are tiled, not overlapping.

Create a new area by splitting an existing area.  
  * Move the mouse to a corner until you see the plus sign cursor.  
  * Now drag the corner to split the window.

Delete an area by joining it to an adjacent window.  
  * Move the mouse to the divider between the areas until you see the double arrow cursor.  
  * Right click.  The two areas become selectable.  
  * Click on the one you want to keep.     

=== Editor ===

Each area contains one editor.

An editor is of an Editor Type.  
There are some 20 editor types grouped into 4 categories.

The top left corner of each area contains an icon button to drop down a menu of Editor Types.  
Use this menu to change the editor shown in the area.
Notice that the icon identifies the editor type.

=== Panel ===

A panel is a rectangular area within an editor.

A panel can be collapsed or expanded.

A panel can grabbed and dragged to reorder the panels.

A panel can have sub-panels.  
For example, in the Properties editor, in the Output panel, 
a different set of sub-panels is shown depending on your setting of File Format.

Some editors contain a side panel on the right that can be toggled into view by clicking n.
[Example: Video Sequencer.]

=== Tabs ===

Tabs are sometimes used to switch among multiple sets of panels.

Tabs can be on the left, the right, or above the panel viewing area.

[Example.  See the Properties Editor.]

=== Preferences ===

Startup File - default file with layouts, settings, and preferences
  * File - Defaults - Save Startup File
  * File - Defaults - Load Factory Settings

Preferences
  * Edit - Preferences - menu - Save Preferences (saves preferences only to the startup file)
  * Edit - Preferences - menu - Load Factory Preferences

The Preferences are a subset of the data in the startup file
and can be saved and reloaded separately.

===== Python within Blender =====

Edit - Preferences - Interface - Python Tooltips: check on

areas (Editor Type - Scripting): 
  * Text Editor - write python scripts here.  Save and open files.  Alt-P to run script.
  * Info - history of python commands executed by the UI.
  * Python Console - interactive python console.  import bpy has been at done automatically.

System Console Window - 
Errors from python scripts run in the Text Editor display in the System Console Window, 
not in the Python Console.
In Linux, start blender from the command line.
The terminal window is the System Console Window.   
If you close the terminal window, Blender stops immediately without saving.

YouTube: Curtis Holt: Python Crash Course for Blender!]]

===== Command-line =====

Blender's command-line options allow you to execute a pipeline of 
digital video processing and rendering
on any number of files in a background, GUI-less process.

  Example: 
      blender <filename.blend> -b -P <scriptname.py>
  
  where:
  -b 
        Run in background, no UI.
  
  -P  <scriptname> 
        Auto-run the named python script.

Layout workspace, 3D viewport

=== move active object ===

t toolbar on the left, toggle on and off\\
buttons to move, rotate, scale, all three

put mouse into a mode
  * g grab
  * r rotate
  * s scale

confine movement to an axis
  * x, y, z
  * click mmb

=== navigate within the world ===

scroll wheel, mmb
  * drag with scroll wheel down, orbit, rotate the view around the center point
  * shift-drag scroll wheel, pan the view away from center
  * scroll wheel, zoom view in and out

gizmo in upper-right corner also allows orbit and and pan 

~ tilde key, emulate numpad

==== Huh? ====
User preferences:
  Emulate numpad on
  Select with left mouse button
  View3D =>View 3D Global => map semicolon to view_selected

Left mouse button: select object (customized)

Middle mouse button: orbit

Shift + middle mouse: pan

Numpad ; focus on select object, view selected (customized)

Numpad 7: top view

Numpad 1: front view

Numpad 3: side view

Numpad 5: swap orthographic and perspective views

shift+A: add an object primitive

==== Force Fields, Particles, Animation ====

Particles move.

Force fields affect the movement of particles.

For a particle to move in space, it must simultaneously move in time, 
hence particle movement is done through animation.

Particles are by nature animated.

Force fields affect the movement of particles.

Force fields can be experienced only in the presence of particles.

Particles can be experienced only in the presence of a force field.

Empty Object
  * can enable physics properties
  * cannot add particle emitter modifier
  * choice of visual representation

Force Field
  * no choice of visual representation, given by type of field

object properties
  * transform
  * relations
  * collections
  * instancing
  * motion paths
  * visibility
  * viewport display
  * custom properties

add "effector", ie "field"

add "empty"

choices at add time
  * type
  * radius
  * align
  * location x,y,z
  * rotation x,y,z

types
  * empty, type of visual representation
  * force field, aka field, aka effector, type of force


=====Video Sequence Editing=====

Solve problems with audio-video sync.
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7qeKekS10E
  * In this video, Mikeycal Myers explains importing videos from a smart phone.
  * Changing the fps from variable to constant 24 using Handbrake.
  * If there is an extra frame on the audio track, use Hold-Offset-End property to bring it back.

scroll and zoom video sequencer (squeeze height of channels)
  * set user preferences input to emulate middle mouse button, using alt by default.
  * alt left drag to scroll sequencer up, down, right, left
  * ctrl alt left drag to zoom sequencer up, down (height), right, left (width)

Timeline
  * mousewheel: zoom in and out horizontally
  * shft-mousewheel: pan timeline up and down
  * ctrl-mousewheel: pan timeline left and right

===== All Together =====

Combine 3D Model, Python, Timeline, Sequencer.

In the Layout editor, choose a camera view.

In the Scene menu, do a Full Copy to create a second scene.  
(You cannot add the current scene to the Sequencer.  
You can only add other non-current scenes.)

In the Sequencer, Add - Scene - select the scene.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8nIHVGWyCY |
YouTube: Adding 3d scene into video sequencer]]

==== Animate drawing on a video ====

You are working in the video sequencer, but \\
the drawing animation must be done in the modeling view. \\
Therefore three steps are required.

  - In the video sequencer:
    - Select your desired section of video.  
    - Render an image sequence of that section.
  - In the modeling view:
    - Add the image sequence from step 1 into the layout or modeling view.
    - Draw over the video.  There are at least two ways to do the drawing.
      - the grease pencil
        * can be drawn by hand
        * must be animated keyframe-to-keyframe by hand
        * [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYYKAUO312c | YouTube: jimmy something doodles: How to draw over videos ]]
      - the bezier curve
        * cannot draw by hand, must manipulate the curve
        * can be animated automatically from one end of the curve to the other
        * [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYYKAUO312c | YouTube: Blender Made Easy: Easy Handwriting Animation ]]
    - Render the animation as a movie.
  - Back in the video sequencer:
    * Add the movie output from step 2
