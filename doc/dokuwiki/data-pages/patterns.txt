====== Patterns ======

intelligence = pattern recognition

Therefore, we will look at patterns.

Gallery of Patterns

Attraction and repulsion

patterns, shapes, fields, force fields

geometric shapes: line, circle, triangle, square, pentangon, ...

Lock and key

Innate patterns within humans: 
  * story-telling, 
  * play-acting, 
  * song, 
  * dance, 
  * drawing, 
  * language,

unification vs divergence

venturi effect in the center of the field

parts of a torus, field
  * venturi effect
  * dense center, diffuse periphery
  * two pyramids
  * spirals
  * discrete levels of energy in rings, distance from center

the center cylinder of a torus: worm, human, electric wire, water pipe

polarity or not

Threshold, discreet levels, solid liquid gas, electron orbits


Kevin Kelly, //Out of Control//, 1992,
on complex chaotic systems that manage without a controlling hierarchy


Elon musk on surface tension, size, why a single cell does not grow large. Diffusion only works at a given size. Above that you need a circulatory system.

Mathematical laws.  Are those patterns?  No.  These are mental description and measurement of a physical system.

Mammals all share the same skeleton.

The big get bigger
