====== Concepts ======

=====Set Theory=====

\begin{align}
A &= \left \{ m,n,o \right \} && \text{A is the set of members m, n, and o} \\
o &\in A && \text{In.  Object o is in set A.} \\
\\
A &\subset B && \text{Subset.  Set A is a subset of set B.} \\
B &\supset A && \text{Superset.  B is a superset of A.} \\
\\
A &\cup B && \text{union of sets A and B} \\
A &\cap B && \text{intersection of sets A and B} \\
A &\setminus B && \text{set difference.  in A, but not in B.} \\
A &\triangle B && \text{symetric difference.  in A or B, but not in both.} \\
A &\times B && \text{Cartesian product.  All possible ordered pairs.} \\
\end{align}

=====Classifications=====

\begin{align}
\mathbb{R} &= \text{real numbers} \\
\mathbb{Q} &= \text{rational numbers (q for quotient)} \\
\mathbb{Z} &= \text{integers } (\cdots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\cdots) \\
\mathbb{N} &= \text{natural numbers, positive integers } (1,2,3,\cdots) \\
\mathbb{W} &= \text{whole numbers, counting numbers, positive integers and zero } (0,1,2,3,\cdots) \\
\mathbb{P} &= \text{prime numbers } (1,3,5,7,11,\cdots) \\

\mathbb{R} &\supset
\mathbb{Q} \supset
\mathbb{Z} \supset
\mathbb{N} \supset 
\mathbb{W} \supset 
\mathbb{P} \\
\\
\mathbb{C} &= \text{complex numbers} \\
\mathbb{C} &\not\subset \mathbb{R} \\
\end{align}

Either boldface $\mathbf{R}$ or "blackboard bold" $\mathbb{R}$ is used to symbolize a set.

==== Real Numbers ====

$\mathbb{R} $

All numbers except imaginary and complex numbers.

Real numbers include integers, fractions, decimals, and zero.

==== Rational Numbers ====

A rational number can be written as a quotient, that is, a fraction, 
a ratio of two integers, like for example
$\frac{3}{1}$ or $\frac{1}{3}$

When written in decimal form, a rational number is terminating or repeating.

$\mathbb{Q}$ represents the set of rational numbers.

==== Irrational Numbers ====

Irrational numbers cannot be written as a quotient.

When written in decimal form, an irrational number never terminates 
and does not repeat.

The following are irrational numbers.

\begin{align}
\pi &= 3.14159265359\cdots && \text{pi}\\
e &= 2.7182818284\cdots && \text{Euler's number}\\
\varphi &= 1.6180339887\cdots && \text{golden ratio} \\
\sqrt{2} &= 1.4142135237\cdots && \text{square root of 2} \\
\end{align}

There is no standard-accepted symbol for the set of irrational numbers, 
though sometimes you see $\mathbb{I}$ or $\mathbb{Q}\prime$ or $(\mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q})$.

====Imaginary Numbers====

An imaginary number is a negative number that can have a square root.  

It is not a real number.

It is written as $bi$ such that $b$ is a real number 
and $i$ is the imaginary unit number.

For example:
  * The square root of $9$ is $3$ or $-3$.
  * The square root of $-9$ is impossible.
  * The square root of $9i$ is $3$ or $-3$.

In that example, $9$, $-9$, $3$, and $-3$ are real numbers, and $9i$ is an imaginary number.

===Imaginary Unit Number===

The imaginary Unit Number $i$ is a special number that exists
for the purpose of creating imaginary numbers.

\begin{align}
i^2 &= -1 \\
i &= \sqrt{-1} \\
\end{align}

===Complex Numbers===

A complex number includes a real part and an imaginary part, 
written in the form $(a + bi)$.

\begin{align}
(a + bi) &\in \mathbb{C} \\
a &= \text{the real part}  \\
bi &= \text{the imaginary part}  \\
i &= \text{the imaginary unit number} \\
a,b &\in \mathbb{R} \\
i, bi &\not\in \mathbb{R} \\
\end{align}

=====Logic=====

\begin{align}
A &\Rightarrow B && \text{if A then B; or, A implies B} &\text{\Rightarrow} \\
A &\iff B && \text{if and only if A, then B} &\text{\iff} \\
A &\therefore B && \text{A is true, therefore B is true} &\text{\therefore} \\
A &\mid B && \text{A, such that B} &\text{\mid} \\
\end{align}

=====Other Concepts=====

Number Theory - a branch of mathematics devoted to the study of integers, 
especially of prime numbers.

Number System - aka numeral system. - a writing system for expressing numbers.
Examples include:
  * base-10 or decimal system, 
  * base-2 or binary system, 
  * base-16 or hexadecimal system
  * base-1 or unary numeral system, used in tallying.
