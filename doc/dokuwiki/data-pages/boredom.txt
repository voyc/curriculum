====== Boredom ======

I was in Orchestra Hall in Chicago, listening to a Mahler symphony.  It was over an hour long.  At one point in the middle I was squirming in my seat, looking around the hall, feeling bored and antsy.  Then about ten minutes before the end, the music had taken a turn.  I was spellbound, electric waves going up and down my spine and limbs, tears of bliss squeezing out of my eyes.

Looking back I can see that the boring part was necessary to set up the finale.  The composer did it deliberately.  It's part of the story-telling.  Just as in the story of human life, the feelings of joy and excitement can exist only in a world that also has sadness and boredom.

Therefore, if I am feeling bored now, it is only the setup for the excitement that is sure to come.
