====== Arduino ======

Arduino is a platform of open source hardware and software for using microcontrollers.

It is known as an educational system for beginners, but is widely used among hobbyists, professionals and commercial entities at all levels. 

Arduino IDE is a software package for writing, compiling and uploading code to a microcontroller.  It is an "Integrated Development Environment (IDE)", including an editor and several tools.

Arduino CLI is a command-line version of the same software.

===== Arduino IDE =====

File - Preferences - Show verbose output during x compilation x upload

Check compilation and upload to get detailed messaging and learn:
  * arduino-builder - the executable run for compile and upload.
  * the name of the board
  * the name of the core
  * the tools and libraries used
  * the include files used and from which folders


===== arduino-cli =====

Display a list of all installed boards, human name and FQBN:
  $ arduino-cli board listall

Display current config settings, print out ~/.arduino15/arduino-cli.yaml:
  $ arduino-cli config dump

Arduino, Arduino CLI, include path

Arduino mpu 6050

Where are the human names of the platforms displayed in the Boards Manager menu?

Why are there two core/library/package/platform for ESP32 Nano?  What is the difference?  Which do I use?

Why is my sk8mini no longer compiling?

When using Tools - Pin Numbering - "By Arduino pin (default)" \\
function digitalPinToGPIONumber(_pin) is added and compile fails

When using Tools - Pin Numbering - "By GPIO number (legacy)" \\
it compiles successfully, but throttle motor does not respond

My code uses D3 and D6 as pin numbers.
Where are these defined?


===== Using Microcontrollers =====

A microcontroller is a type of integrated circuit (IC), a chip.

A microcontroller is programmable.

1.  Upload, burn, or flash a program into the chip's memory.

2.  Power-up the chip in normal mode, and your program starts running automatically.

Each microcontroller contains a logic processor which runs a specific language.

The manufacture provides a compiler, and instructions for loading a compiled program into the microcontroller.

It may seem like a hassle to deal with all of the details and quirks of programming the many various microcontrollers available.

The Arduino IDE, and several similar products, attempt to simplify this situation for beginner developers by providing tools that operate universally across all microcontroller products.

Ideally you can write a C++ program for the ATmega328P microcontroller, and then later run that same program on an ESP32 microcontroller.

The Arduino IDE takes care of all the chip-specific details behind the scenes and lets the developer concentrate on the program logic.

Unfortunately, programs like this often become gate-keepers, hiding the truth from ordinary folks.  "You don't need to know that."  Sooner or later, as a result of problem solving, developers are forced to spend inordinate amounts of time figuring out what the IDE is doing, in order to debug the problem.


===== Terms =====

sketch = a c++ program in a text file with extension ".ino", in a folder with the same name.

Packages, cores, libraries, tools

package vs core vs platform

components:
  * editor
  * compiler
  * uploader

"List all boards that have the support platform installed."

"Search for a board in the Boards Manager using the specified keywords."

"Upload the bootloader on the board using an external programmer."

"completion script"

"platform"


Boards Manager - the compiler and uploader work differently depending on the board.

The "board" refers to the PCB, the microcontroller.

With the IDE, you are always working with one microcontroller.
The microcontroller is connected to a serial port.
You use the Boards Manager to specify the mfg/model of the microcontroller.

1. Plug your microcontroller into a serial port on your computer.
2. In the IDE menu, goto Tools - Boards Manager.


Tools menu:

  * Board - select your board mfg/model from the menu.  If it's not there, click on Boards Manager to select and install the core for your board mfg/model.
  * Port - Which port is your board plugged into?  Select from menu.
  * Get board info - If Board and Port are selected correctly, returns the mfg/model of the connected board.
  * Manage libraries - Download and install software libraries for special functions and specific boards.  Select from menu.

Boards Manager - where is this list of "packages"?

Library Manager - where is this list of libraries?

Each of these folders contains a file named boards.txt.
boards.txt contains a number of key=value parameters grouped into sections.
It includes a name= keyword that identifies the name as displayed in the board menu in the IDE.

nano_nora.name=Arduino Nano ESP32
This board is found in two packages.
~/.arduino15/packages/esp32/hardware/esp32/2.0.13/boards.txt  - this one has many boards
~/.arduino15/packages/arduino/hardware/esp32/2.0.13/boards.txt - this has only the one board 

The CLI needs the FQBN for the board.  Where is that specified?

I have 5 Nano ESP32 boards installed.  WTF?

==== Uploading Software to a Microcontroller ====

Uploading software to a microcontroller is done with serial communications.


===== Serial Communications =====

FTDI - FTDI is a company name.  They make a chip for serial communications that is used in many boards.

CH340C - USB to serial converter chip, made by SeeedStudio

reset

boot mode

enter the bootloader

serial communications - data transfer, 1 wire, 1 bit at a time, 2 parties: transmitter and receiver, 2 pins: RX, TX.  wires from master's TX to listener's RX.  Baud rate, stop bit, parity bit.  Choice of signal methods: TTL or RS232.

USB - not considered "serial communications", USB to serial converter

RS232 - a serial communication, +/-13V

TTL - Transistor-transistor-logic, a serial communication, 0 to 3.3V/5V

UART - Universally Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter, a transmission method


=== USB to Serial chip ===

CP2102,, Silicon Labs, SINGLE-CHIP USB TO UART BRIDGE, requires drivers
https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/IC/cp2102.pdf

FT232RL,, FTDI, (my board is from HiLetGo, is NOT genuine FTDI, and I have NOT gotten it to work with ESP32-CAM)

CH340G, CH340C - USB to serial chip, used by ESP32-CAM-MB (mine is from Aideepen, and it works)

Atmega16U2 - an MCU programmed as a USB-to-serial converter (used by Arduino Uno R3)

=== USB to Serial board ===

FTDI, , 6 pins: DTR, RX, TX, VCC, CTS, GND

chips and boards, ICs and PCBs

boards: converter, adapter, module, programmer, breakout, developer, 


===== Logic =====

Math, Computer Science

If, then, else


=== Assembly Language ===
Must be assembled and linked, using an assembler and linker.

Logic can be implemented in assembly language programming.  Not logic itself.
Test, branch on condition.
Expressed via flowchart instead of pseudo-code.
branch = jump = goto

Compare x to 3
if greater, goto a label
if lesser, goto a different label
if equal, goto still another label
