====== github ======

Microsoft has purchased Github, and they are slowly sinking it.\\
Eventually I will have to move to another git platform, possibly private.

=== Change default branch from "master" to "main". ===

Therefore, after creating a new repo, before cloning it:

  * Create a new branch named "master".
  * Make "master" the default branch.
  * Delete the "main" branch.

Now feel free to clone the repository.
