====== Progressive ======


The common flash card algorithms
  * Sequential.  Start with a set of 20 cards.  Go through them one after the other.  Repeat.
  * Random shuffle.  Same as sequential, but shuffle the cards into a random order before each repeat.
  * Elimination.  When a card is mastered, remove it from the sequence.  So each repeat has fewer and fewer cards until all are mastered.

The Progressive algorithm \\
Assume that 20 cards is too many.  The user misses all 20 to begin with and is discouraged to try again.

Progressive.  Start with a working set of 3 out of the 20 cards.  Shuffle and repeat.  Gradually introduce additional cards into the working set, and eliminate mastered cards, until he has mastered all 20.

The progressive mode of flash card operation lets a user start slow with just two or three cards, and as he learns these, more cards are added gradually.
