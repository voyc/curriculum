====== External Data Sources ======

External data comes in from these sources:

  - onScriptLoaded(subject data) - from pages/*.js
    * flash.js switches the page and then passes data to Program object
  - onLoadData(data) - from an external windows such as Sanskrit Keyboard
    * postMessage: window.addEventListener("message", function(e) {
    * flash.js reads the data to generate a new page and then passes data to Program object
  - from getCards data service
    * directly handled by Program object
  - from localStorage
    * onstartup
    * when previous session is stored in localStorage

Data Portal: \\
program.loadData(data)\\
Card(quest) constructor \\

The incoming data object is external to the closure compiler,
and therefore references to it must use brackets-quoted-string notation.
  - We first pass the data object to program.loadData().
  - Here the data is pulled out and loaded into internal objects, and the original external data object is discarded.
  - The internal objects are then accessed by dot-notation.
