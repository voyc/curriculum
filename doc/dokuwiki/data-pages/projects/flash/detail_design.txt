=== Pull ===


=== Next Question ===

=== Startup ===
program publishes "program-ready".

=== Auto Dir ===
isAutoDir is boolean. \\
isAutoDir is maintained by object program. \\
When user clicks button, program toggles isAutoDir, and publishes "changedirection-complete". \\

Two objects subscribe to changedirection-complete: coach and desk. \\
Coach - save internal copy of isAutoDir, call Pull, call Next Question.\\
Desk - save internal copy of isAutoDir, changes UI.\\
