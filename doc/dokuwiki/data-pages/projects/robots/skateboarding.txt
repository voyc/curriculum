====== Skateboarding ======

skateboard cones               

Three events:   
  * barrel racing
  * slalom https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYSr-Sft4Zk
  * freestyle

Freestyle Aesthetics:         
  * choose order of barrels
  * choose direction around each barrel, cw or ccw
  * collision detect
    * pass by with slight bend, or
    * circle around

Multi*tasking:
  * strategy, plot course (see Aesthetics)
  * tactics, steering, staying on course

steering:                                
  * calc relative bearing
  * set steering angle

plot course:
  * calc entry and exit points for the arc around each cone
    * enter on the left, go clockwise around the cone
    * enter on the right, go counter-clockwise
