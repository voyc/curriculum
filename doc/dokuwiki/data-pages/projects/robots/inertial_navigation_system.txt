INS Intertial Navigation System - Sensors, processors, and software to estimate position.

3D cartesian space - a cube, 3 dimensions: x,y,z

A vehicle exists in 3D cartesian space.  It can be measured in three dimensions, such as width, height, and depth.

The movement of a vehicle can also be measured in 3 dimensions: x, y, and z.


  * The x-axis runs the length of the vehicle, from nose to tail.
  * The y-axis runs from side to side, from wingtip to wingtip.
  * The z-axis runs up and down, from the center of the earth on up.

Motion sensors measure the movement of a vehicle along the three axes.

  * accelerometer - measures linear motion along an axis.
  * gyroscope - measures rotational motion around an axis.


  * magnetometer - measures the strength of the magnetic fields operating on a vehicle. 
  * barometer/altimeter - measures air pressure, which can be used to calculate altitude above sea level.


=== Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) ===

A collection of 3 accelerometers and 3 gyroscopes.
This device gives us six numbers: linear motion along each of the x,y,z axes, 
and rotational motion around each of the x,y,z axes.
This gives us the complete picture of inertial motion of the vehicle.


It is not enough to measure motion.
We also need to know our current position, or orientation, or attitude.

Imagine we experienced an acceleration along the x-axis for two seconds.
During that two seconds we went from standing still to moving upwards at 8 meters per second squared. 
Now where are we 

???? does the accelerometer measure acceleration or motion ?

3 types of accelerometer: mems, piezo electric, piezo resistive

velocity vs acceleration

per Steppe School youtubes:

bias, aka offset, must be removed from each measurement
  * accelerometer
    * measures linear acceleration, not velocity
    * unit: mg, 1g = 9.8 m/s2, 1mg = 1 thousandth of a g
    * has bias, but not so critical as gyroscope and magnetometer 
    * gravity is an acceleration of 1g or 1000mg.  This acceleration is always acting on the sensor.
    * the upright and at-rest measurement should be x:0, y:0, z:1000.
    * as the sensor is rotated the acceleration due to gravity is distributed among the x,y,z axes.
  * gyroscope
    * gyroscope measures angular velocity, not acceleration
    * gyroscope unit: degrees per second
    * at rest, gyroscope returns the bias
    * by subtracting the bias from a readingd, the at rest measurement is x:0, y:0, z:1000
    * calibration is done at rest for some seconds, the average of readings is the bias
    * 20948 chip has "offset" registers that we can set with the 3 bias values, each divided by 4
  * magnetometer
    * no registers, so we must keep variables and do the subtraction from each measurement
    * calibration is done during 3D rotation for some seconds
    * ((max - min) / 2) should be zero, so the actual value during calibration is the bias
    * in addition to the bias, we also have an adjustment for declination, to convert magnetic north to true north 

localization = changing reference system from the body of the sensor to the earth
  * sensor readings give data relative to the body, the vehicle
  * ahrs values give data relative to the earth

units:
  * linear velocity: meters per second
  * linear acceleration: meters per second squared
  * angular velocity: degrees per second, radians per second
  * angular acceleration: ?
  * rotation velocity: hertz, cycles per second
  * 10**-6  one millionth, μ, micro
  * 10**-3  one thousandth, m, milli

accelerometer and gyroscope measure motion
we know that the z-axis is pointing straight up, but the x and y-axes are relative to some random or arbitrary starting point
by adding a magnetometer, we can fix the x axis relative to north-south, and the y-axis relative to east-west

the magnetometer measures the strength of magnetic fields acting on the sensor
the most significant magnetic field is that of the earth

naming absurdities: 
  * IMU inertial measurement unit
    * does not measure inertia. It's components measure accleration, velocity, and magnetic field strenth.
    * is not a unit of measurement
  * 6-axis imu or 9-axis imu.  There are only three axes: x,y,z.
  * 6dof or 9dof.  A sensor does not have degrees of freedom.


==== AHRS ====
AHRS - Attitude and Heading Reference System - 

Attitude - the orientation of a vehicle in cartesian space.  Pitch, roll, yaw.

Heading - the direction a vehicle is facing, the x-axis, in compass degrees.

Dead reckoning - estimate current position of a vehicle by keeping track of changes in speed and direction over time. 



IMU
Kalman Filter, a type of sensor fusion
Low Pass Filter
GPS - 1 meter accuracy at best, 3 meter average in position. No heading info. 
Sensor Fusion 
DMP

RTK - two gps: base station plus rover, triangulate, to get position with 1 cm accuracy
Compassing - two gps to get heading

Odometer - wheel odometer
Cameras
Lidar 

IMU - 3x3 sensors
AHRS - use kalman filter to fuse sensor data and output roll, pitch, and yaw
INS - add gps input and dead reckoning to the Kalman Filter, for position and heading

Magnetometer calibration
hold the sensor level and spin it horizontally
the graph of the results should be a perfect circle, and the radius of the circle is the strength of the magnetic field
https://youtu.be/MinV5V1ioWg?si=Bh-e9aDgxxzKsm14

Scott Lobdell, on AHRS calculations, specifically the Madgwick Quaternion Update
start with 9 measurements from the 3 sensors * 3 axes
calibrate the magnetometer using a 3D bias to get corrected values of the 3 magnetometer measurements
begin ahrs
localize the acceleration vector from [x,y,z] to [north,east,down]
convert the 9 measurements into a quaternion
convert the quaternion into a 3x3 rotation matrix
multiply the acceleration vector times the inverse of the rotation matrix, giving the localized acceleration vector
remove the acceleration due to gravity [0,0,1] to [0,0,0]
apply the declination offset
