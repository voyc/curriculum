Fixed or implemented in current commit



Bugs
  * both geo/geo.js and js/texture.js contain a drawTexture() function
  * loading order, land first, add importance to list.sort and renametiles
  * touch and zooming does not use noscrollgroup, fast-twitch
  * texture mercator displays as cylindrical
  * pointInPolygon() does not always work, see Crystal Mountains
  * rank 1,2 gridlines hit only sometimes
    * seems to always work at intersection with other geoms
  * treat wheel zoom same as zoom slider
  * timepicker, arrow keys attempt string instead of numeric addition, until after first use of slider
  * timeslider appears on startup even when history layer is disabled
  * hilite of cities, has moved true, redraws whole screen ?

Features
  * setup ctx ahead of time, not at draw time, after layer creation, "fixup layer palettes"
  * db update for editing base layers
  * db update for custom layers
  * cities and treasure layers with point medalions
  * Little x to close label, main menu, search results
  * North button, appears when gamma non-zero
  * time
    * add <<  >> fast forward
    * when touching mouse to date, resolve to slider
  * clear hilite on zoom (or reposition label on every move/zoom redraw)
  * layer choice:
    * water, land, mountains, deserts - fast-twitch, quick draw
    * lores - when ready
    * hires - when ready and scale > 2.4
  * mercator stitch, in GeoIteratorClip
    * draw texture mercator wraps around antimeridian (yay)
    * make vector layers do the same
  * animate projection switch, equirectangular projection

Layer Editor
  * name
  * description
  * palettes (line/point/poly), scaling, multicolored
  * (Sketch and custom use three palettes)
  * Edit layer 
    * x. save geom in custom01
    * 2. save geom in any custom layer, from menu of custom layers
    * 3. edit an already existing shape
      * how do we select a shape for editing?
        * before saving, you can grab any point and move it
        * you can select any object on the page and begin editing it, moving points, close it if not already 
      * how do we select a layer for editing?
    * 4. save in base layer, restricted shape type
      * setting: allow base layer editing
  * Edit custom layers
      * x put layer menu in local storage
      * new layer
      * attributes and data saved in database by userid
