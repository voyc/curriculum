====== Map Projections ======

Projecting a 3D sphere onto a 2D map results in distortions.

Place a lamp in the center of a translucent sphere. Let it project a shadow onto a sheet, hanging flat or curled in a cylinder.

All 2D maps are distorted.  Distortion occurs in:
  * shapes
  * areas
  * distances
  * directions
  * angles

Types of distortion correction:
  * conformal - preserves angles
  * equal-area - preserves areas

Each type of map projection has a different approach to distortion correction.

Three projection types, with variations:
  * conic
    * Albers
    * Equidistant
    * Lambert Conformal
  * cylindrical
    * **Equirectangular**
    * **Mercator**
  * planar
    * azimuthal perspective
      * **orthographic**

===== Cylindrical Projection =====

===== Equirectangular Projection =====

aka equidistant cylindrical projection, geographic projection, lat/lon projection, or plane chart

Stretch the sphere into a cylinder.

Then unroll like peeling the label off a soup can.

Shapes at the poles are stretched horizontally.

===== Mercator Projection =====

Start with the Equirectangular Projection.

Stretch it vertically, to match the horizontal stretch of the equirectangular projection.

The amount of stretch increases geometrically with distance from the equator.


===== Orthographic Projection =====

The orthographic projection looks like a globe.

It can display only one hemisphere at a time.

Only the center of the map is free of distortion. Distortion values increase radially from the origin.

The orthographic projection is neither conformal nor equal-area. Shapes, areas, distances, directions, and angles are all generally distorted.

===== Web Mercator Projection =====

mercator uses ellipsoid model, has time-consuming calculation\\
webmercator uses spheroid model, introduces "zoom level", and simplifies the calculation\\
a sphere is a subset of an ellipsoid object\\


Similar to mercator, but with much faster calculation.
