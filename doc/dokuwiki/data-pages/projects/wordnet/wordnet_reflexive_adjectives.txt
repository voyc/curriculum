====== WordNet Reflexive Adjectives ======

Many pointer types are reflexive, meaning that if a synset contains a pointer to another synset, the other synset should contain a corresponding reflexive pointer. grind(link is external)(1WN)(link is external) automatically inserts missing reflexive pointers for the following pointer types:
