====== Wordnet Pointers ======

pointer - relation between two sunsets.  There are two types of relation: lexical and semantic.

semantic relation - between word meanings

lexical relation - between word forms

Semantic pointers pertain to all of the words in the source and target synsets. 

Lexical pointers pertain only to specific words in the source and target synsets. 

There are five lexical relation types: Antonym, Pertainym, Participle, Also See, Derivationally Related. 

All other relation types are semantic.

Here is a complete list of relation pointers

==== Reflexive Pointers ====
Many pointer types are reflexive, meaning that if a synset contains a pointer to another synset, the other synset should contain a corresponding reflexive pointer. grind(link is external)(1WN)(link is external) automatically inserts missing reflexive pointers for the following pointer types:

^pointer^reflect^
|Antonym	|Antonym|
|Hyponym	|Hypernym|
|Hypernym	|Hyponym|
|Instance Hyponym	|Instance Hypernym|
|Instance Hypernym	|Instance Hyponym|
|Holonym	|Meronym|
|Meronym	|Holonym|
|Similar to	|Similar to|
|Attribute	|Attribute|
|Verb Group	|Verb Group|
|Derivationally Related	|Derivationally Related|
|Domain of synset	|Member of Doman|

===== Verb Frames =====
Each verb synset contains a list of generic sentence frames illustrating the types of simple sentences in which the verbs in the synset can be used. For some verb senses, example sentences illustrating actual uses of the verb are provided. (See Verb Example Sentences in wndb(5WN) .) Whenever there is no example sentence, the generic sentence frames specified by the lexicographer are used. The generic sentence frames are entered in a synset as a comma-separated list of integer frame numbers. The following list is the text of the generic frames, preceded by their frame numbers:

There are 35 verb frames, numbered 1 thru 35, listed in the file verb.Framestext. \\
In the verb lexicography files, the frames relevant to a verb synset are listed by number after the synset and before the definition, in the form frames: 10 or frames: 8,9,35.

^frame number^generic frame^

|2    |Somebody ----s |
