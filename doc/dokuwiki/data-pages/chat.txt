====== Chat ======

===== definitions =====
**chat client and server** - The server accepts connection requests from the clients and organizes them into conversations or chatrooms.  Each client sends messages to the server, and the server forwards those messages to appropriate clients.

**socket** - A chat client and server can be implemented using sockets.  The clients can be implemented with a GUI or using the terminal command line.  This requires a network, but not the internet.

**webchat** - must run over the internet with the client chat window in a browser page, and it must use TCP and HTTP.  Prior to 2010, webchat would require client polling, constantly checking for new messages.

**websocket** - Since 2010, with HTML5, the websocket protocol enables full-duplex (two-way) communications over the internet, after a connection between client and server.

**WAMP** - Web Application Messaging Protocol.  Two additional protocols built on top of websockets.
  * Publish and Subscribe (PubSub)
  * rRPC - routed Remote Procedure Calls
