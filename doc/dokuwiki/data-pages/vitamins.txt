In an ideal world, we would all eat very low-processed, organic and nutrient-dense diets filled with all sorts of foods that provide us with the vitamins we need. But this isn’t always possible or realistic for many men, leaving a lot of room for common nutrient deficiencies and health problems as a consequence. Many people assume vitamin or mineral deficiencies are mostly a third-world problem in the 21st century, but in fact research tells us that even in developed nations, the best vitamins for men aren’t consumed enough.

A high percentage of men today eating a typical “western diet” experience at least one type of vitamin or nutrient deficiency, mostly due to eating a poor diet that’s low in vitamin-rich foods like veggies and fruit. In 2009, a report by NBC News stated that “studies show 77 percent of men don’t take in enough magnesium, that many of us are deficient in vitamin D, and that the vitamin B12 in our diets may be undermined by a common heartburn medication. And we haven’t even mentioned our problems with potassium and iodine yet.” (1)

Make no mistake, men are just as susceptible as women are to experiencing low vitamin and mineral levels. Resolving deficiencies and consuming more nutrients help improve many aspects of a man’s overall health: better muscle strength and gains, a faster metabolism and fat loss, more energy, better sleep, improved sexual performance, and protection against health problems like a heat attack, colon or prostate cancer. That’s why it’s important to get as much of the best vitamins for men as possible in your diet, just as it’s crucial for the opposite sex to obtain the best vitamins for women, many of which overlap due to these damaging deficiencies.

The Best Vitamins for Men

Based on statistics about which vitamins a high percentage of men might be missing, here are some of the most important and best vitamins for men to make sure you or your loved one gets enough of:

===Vitamin D===

produce enough testosterone, maintain strong bones, protect brain health, prevent mood disorders like depression, and help control cholesterol and blood pressure levels, helping lower inflammation

eggs, some dairy products and even certain mushrooms,
exposed to the sun, without wearing much or any sunscreen. By spending 15–20 minutes outside most days of the week without sunscreen

===Vitamin B12===

vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to fatigue and central nervous system problems.

animal proteins, especially lamb, beef and salmon

===Antioxidant Vitamins (Vitamins A, C and E)===

fighting free radical damage (also called oxidative stress), which speeds up the aging process and puts men at a greater risk for problems like cancer, cognitive decline, vision loss and heart disease. (6)

protect healthy cells, prevent cell mutations and tumor growth, and spare muscle wasting/sarcopenia, artery damage and tissue loss.

A and E deficiency symptoms: Dry, irritated skin and poor vision (including night blindness or sensitivity to light) could be a sign that you’re low in vitamin A or vitamin E,

C deficiency: weakened immune system, frequently getting sick, swollen gums and nosebleeds.

A and C: Making sure to “eat a rainbow” worth of different colorful vitamin C foods, veggies and fruits, particularly dark leafy greens like spinach, kale or collard greens

E: plus nuts and seeds like almonds and sunflower seeds

===Vitamin K===

building and maintaining strong bones, blood clotting, and preventing heart disease


Vitamin K1 is found in many green vegetables,
vitamin K2 is found in things like dairy products.

The best way to prevent vitamin K deficiency is to eat plenty of different veggies, including green leafy vegetables, broccoli, collards and cabbage, plus some wild-caught fish and cage-free eggs too.

===Magnesium===

an essential electrolyte mineral involved in over 300 different chemical processes.
plays a part in regulating calcium, potassium and sodium levels,
helping prevent conditions like high blood pressure, muscle spasms, headaches and heart disease.

Signs of magnesium deficiency: muscle twitches, anxiety, trouble going to the bathroom, and difficulty getting good sleep, for example.

leafy green veggies, cruciferous veggies, sea vegetables/algae, beans, nuts and seeds.


===Omega-3 Fish Oils===

wild-caught fish, such as salmon, sardines, tuna and halibut
also eggs, nuts and seeds.

===Potassium===

Low potassium raises the risk for cardiovascular problems, especially high blood pressure, which affects about one in every three adult men. It’s also been linked with poor bone health, a sluggish metabolism, fatigue (since it helps your cells use glucose for energy), poor digestion and muscle spasms.

beans, avocado, sweet potato, bananas, salmon and grass-fed beef

==Notes==

Vegetarians and vegans are more likely to be low in vitamin B12, iron, certain essential amino acids and omega-3s. If you avoid animal foods all together, it’s a smart idea to take a daily supplement, and if you don’t consume much fish or seafood regularly, chances are you can use extra omega-3s.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common
