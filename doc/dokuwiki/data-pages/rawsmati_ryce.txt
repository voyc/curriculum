Ingredients:
  *  1/2 cup raw pine nuts, cashews, or macadamias
  *  1/2 cup hard, fresh coconut meat, chopped
  *  2 cups chopped fresh palm hearts (palmito)
  *  1 large jicama root, peeled and chopped
  *  Juice of 1 lime

Directions:

In a food processor with the S-blade, finely chop raw pine nuts, cashews, or macadamias.
Scrape down, then add one or combination of the coconut meat, palm hearts, and jicama root.
Pulse chop until you get a sticky coarse texture. Then transfer mixture to a bowl and hand mix in juice of 1 lime.

You can mold it in a bowl, serve it on a lettuce leaf, stuffed in a tomato, or in sushi. Just like real rice. The Moroccan recipe actually fooled a professional deli chef who thought I made cooked rice, and he said my raw version tasted better and fresher than his cooked recipe he'd been using for years. Its a hit at weddings and even non-vegans love sushi made with this ryce.
