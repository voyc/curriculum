===== Radiation =====

Electromagnetic radiation is absorbed or emitted as electrons move out or in among the shells respectively. Electrons in the higher shells have a higher energy level than those in the inner shells.

A radioactive element has an unstable nucleus. the unstable nucleus will Decay by emitting particles until it becomes stable.

Four types of nuclear radiation, defined by the type of particle emitted from the nucleus.

  * Alpha particle, same structure as a helium nucleus.
  * Beta particle, Electron, formed when a neutron splits into a proton and an electron
  * Gamma rays, a type of electromagnetic radiation
  * Neutron

===== Coffee =====

grind: course, medium, fine
filter coffee: one coffee bean yields 100 particles
espresso: 3,000 particles
Turkish coffee: 45,000 particles

Turkish coffee world

Turkish coffee.
On medium heat until just before it starts to boil. 
Should take 7 to 10 minutes.

Turkish coffee has stronger flavor and less caffeine than espresso.
Turkish coffee uses Arabica beans, medium to dark roast, extra fine grind.

How is Turkish coffee different from regular coffee?
The difference between Turkish coffee and regular coffee is the grind size and brewing method. Firstly, grounds used in Turkish coffee are extra fine (finer than espresso) and are brewed in a special pot called cezve. Secondly, the brewing process involves a so-called first rise and second rise - even a third rise according to pro Turkish coffee brewers - producing a thick, intensely flavoured cup of coffee topped with perfect foam.

Drink at 65°C
Average Body 37°C

80°C (my new thermometer aimed at boiling water)

Aero press
15g coffee
250g water
16:1
Temperature: 
Brew time: 1.5 mikes
Grind: fine sand

Bean is 70% cellulose, 30% solubles
Cellulose gives bean it's structure and solidity but is not water-soluble
Solubles give color, flavor, aroma
Strong vs weak: water coffee ratio
Under-developed vs bitter: brew time

==copper, stainless steel, tin, aluminum==

“Copper is king here: It has nearly twice the thermal conductivity of aluminum… is five times more conductive than cast iron and 25 times more than stainless steel. Serious cooks love copper for this quality.” The first thing you'll notice when using tin-lined copper cookware is how fast it heats up.
Q:
I have some heavy pans in which the tin lining has worn away and the copper is showing through. Should I have them re-lined? Where can I have this done, and how much might it cost? Is it unhealthy to cook with the copper exposed?

Grace Low, Eugene, OR

A:
Copper is unbeatable for cooking because it conducts heat so evenly. Tin-lined pans are wonderful, but the lining may be harmed by temperatures higher than 405 degrees F, or by long use. You should have your pans retinned because exposed copper can be toxic.

The cost of retinning is about half the cost of a new pan. Any silversmith should be able to provide this service. Look in the Yellow Pages, or call the best cookware store in your area and see whom they recommend. In the future, you could buy stainless-steel-lined copper pans, which cost about twice as much, but don’t wear out like tin-lined pans do.

using example of combining aluminum and oxygen (dioxygen) to form aluminum oxide

finding the quantity of each molecule on both sides of the equation.

The initial equation identifies the molecules and the reaction.  Theoretical

Balancing shows the quantity of each molecule in the reaction.  Actual

1.  the molecules involved

2.  the quantity of each molecule

3.  the change in charge of each molecule

4.  the energy exchange (thermodynamics)


===== Complete vs Net Equations =====

Molecular equation:
$$\ce{NaCl(aq) + AgNO3(aq) -> NaNO3(aq) + AgCl(s)}$$

Complete ionic equation:
$$\ce{Na+(aq) + Cl^{-}(aq) + Ag+(aq) + NO3^{-}(aq) -> Na+NO3^{-}(aq) + AgCl(s)}$$

===== Energy States ======

electrons

electro-negativity


how energy is released or required when an electron changes state



shell = energy level

outer shells have higher energy level ?
===== Electron Configuration =====

==== Binding Energy ====

shells
subshells and orbitals

Electrons closer to the nucleus have a higher binding energy.
They are bound more tightly to the nucleus.
It takes more energy to knock them away from the nucleus.

{{https://youtu.be/UaTWrOTh4qU | Salman Khan: Introduction to photoelectron spectroscopy}}

Atoms are bombarded with XRay photons which knock the electrons away from the nucleus
onto a detector.
The detector then gives us a map of the binding energy of the electrons.
The photoelectron spectrum.
Electrons from the outer shell fly the farthest because they have the lowest binding energy.

==== Valence ====

{{https://youtu.be/cZTdBsAjPPk | Salman Khan: Valence electrons}}

Knowing the configuration of electrons in an atom gives us clues as to how 
that atom will react to other atoms.
  * is it reactive or inert?
  * will it dissolve in water?  hydrophobia, hydrophillic  (attraction, repulsion)
  * is it electronegative
  * does it conduct electricity
  * does it have polarity
  * does it have a charge?  neutral, positive, or negative
  * is it radioactive?
  * at what temperature does it convert from solid to liquid to gas? 
  * 
==== Atomic radius ====

{{https://youtu.be/q--2WP8wXtk | Salman Khan: Atomic radius trends on periodic table}}

Coulomb attraction: between nucleus and electrons.

Atoms get smaller trending to the right on the periodic table.  
Because the larger number of protons creates a stronger positive charge in the nucleus
and the larger number of valence electrons creates a stronger negative charge in the outer
shell.
So these stronger charges pull the electron shells in closer to the nucleus.

So krypton is smaller than potassium.  
It has more protons and electrons, so you might think it would be bigger.
But it is smaller because of the increased charge.

Helium is the smallest atom.  Smaller than hydrogen.

The radius increases down and to the right across the periodic table.
Down, because each additional shell is farther away from the nucleus.
To the right, because the charge between the nucleus and the outer shell increases.
