==== Characteristics of Elements ====

===== Molecules =====

==== Molecular Structure ====

==== Characteristics of Compounds ====

acid = molecule or ion capable of:
  * donating a proton
  * making a covalent bond with an electron pair


===== Energy States ======

electrons

electro-negativity


how energy is released or required when an electron changes state



shell = energy level

outer shells have higher energy level ?
===== Electron Configuration =====

==== Binding Energy ====

shells
subshells and orbitals

Electrons closer to the nucleus have a higher binding energy.
They are bound more tightly to the nucleus.
It takes more energy to knock them away from the nucleus.

{{https://youtu.be/UaTWrOTh4qU | Salman Khan: Introduction to photoelectron spectroscopy}}

Atoms are bombarded with XRay photons which knock the electrons away from the nucleus
onto a detector.
The detector then gives us a map of the binding energy of the electrons.
The photoelectron spectrum.
Electrons from the outer shell fly the farthest because they have the lowest binding energy.

==== Valence ====

{{https://youtu.be/cZTdBsAjPPk | Salman Khan: Valence electrons}}

Knowing the configuration of electrons in an atom gives us clues as to how 
that atom will react to other atoms.
  * is it reactive or inert?
  * will it dissolve in water?  hydrophobia, hydrophillic  (attraction, repulsion)
  * is it electronegative
  * does it conduct electricity
  * does it have polarity
  * does it have a charge?  neutral, positive, or negative
  * is it radioactive?
  * at what temperature does it convert from solid to liquid to gas? 
  * 
==== Atomic radius ====

{{https://youtu.be/q--2WP8wXtk | Salman Khan: Atomic radius trends on periodic table}}

Coulomb attraction: between nucleus and electrons.

Atoms get smaller trending to the right on the periodic table.  
Because the larger number of protons creates a stronger positive charge in the nucleus
and the larger number of valence electrons creates a stronger negative charge in the outer
shell.
So these stronger charges pull the electron shells in closer to the nucleus.

So krypton is smaller than potassium.  
It has more protons and electrons, so you might think it would be bigger.
But it is smaller because of the increased charge.

Helium is the smallest atom.  Smaller than hydrogen.

The radius increases down and to the right across the periodic table.
Down, because each additional shell is farther away from the nucleus.
To the right, because the charge between the nucleus and the outer shell increases. 

===== Analytic Chemistry =====

Analyze a mixture.  What chemicals are there by mass?

isotopes

atomic mass for each element
