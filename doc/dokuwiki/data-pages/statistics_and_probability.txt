====== Statistics and Probability ======

Statistics and probability are related areas of mathematics 
which concern themselves with analyzing the relative frequency of events.

[[Statistics]] looks at the past.  Events that have already happened.

[[Probability]] looks at the future.  What event is likely to happen next?

(Draw a picture, with a line and arrow pointing back into the past, and forward into the future.)


Statistics are the inputs to probability calculations.

Probability can only be computed based on statistics.

The future can only be predicted by looking at what has happened in the past.


For example, draw a line graph, basic algebra.
What is the probability that a point with x value equal to 7 will have a y value of 42?
