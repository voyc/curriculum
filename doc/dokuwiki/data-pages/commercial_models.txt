===== Vehicles using ArduPilot =====

  * Tello vs Tello EDU
    * According to two youtubers, there are two features added to the EDU model:
      - Tello EDU supports Swift, Python, Scratch, while Tello supports only Swift
      - Tello EDU supports swarms, Tello does not
    * Presumably the above applies to onboard software added to the EDU.  Because obviously if you are flying the Tello from a computer on the ground, you can use any language and any number of drones.
