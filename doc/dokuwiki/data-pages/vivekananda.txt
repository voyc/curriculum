Practical Mysticism 2011

Swami Vivekananda, a great mystic teacher from India, is considered a key figure in the introduction of Hindu philosophies of [[Vedanta]] and Yoga in Europe and America.  He is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the end of the 19th century.

== Why is Vivekananda considered a mystic ==

In his own words:

<blockquote>When an idea exclusively occupies the mind, it is transformed into an actual physical or mental state.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In one word, this ideal is that you are divine.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All differences in this world are of degree, and not of kind, because oneness is the secret of everything.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The moment I have realized God sitting in the temple of every human body, the moment I stand in reverence before every human being and see God in him - that moment I am free from bondage, everything that binds vanishes, and I am free.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All the powers in the universe are already ours. It is we who have put our hands before our eyes and cry that it is dark.</blockquote>

His advice for daily living:

<blockquote>It is our own mental attitude which makes the world what it is for us. Our thought make things beautiful, our thoughts make things ugly. The whole world is in our own minds. Learn to see things in the proper light.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Never think there is anything impossible for the soul. It is the greatest heresy to think so. If there is sin, this is the only sin ? to say that you are weak, or others are weak.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Where can we go to find God if we cannot see Him in our own hearts and in every living being.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If faith in ourselves had been more extensively taught and practiced, I am sure a very large portion of the evils and miseries that we have would have vanished.</blockquote>

I don't know why, but this piece of advice really caught my interest:

<blockquote>Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. </blockquote>
