WiFi 6 = 802.11ax

earlier versions: 802.11ac, 802.11a/g/b/n

dual band: 2.4GHz and 5GHz

Wifi 6 does NOT imply 5GHz


=== Prototyping Electronic Circuits ===

Three types of boards.  All use square grid of 0.1 inches (2.54 mm) spacing to accomodate DIP chips.

perfboard - holes, each hole surrounded by with square or round solder pad

stripboard - holes and strips, aka Veroboard

breadboard - solderless holes and strips, aka protoboard

stacking with standoffs
