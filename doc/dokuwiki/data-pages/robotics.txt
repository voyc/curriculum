A cyborg (/ˈsaɪbɔːrɡ/), a portmanteau of "cybernetic organism", is a being with both organic and biomechatronic body parts. The term was coined in 1960 by Manfred Clynes and Nathan S. Kline.[1]

The term cyborg is not the same thing as bionic, biorobot or android; it

Servo

The word "servo" usually implies position control, and is usually controlled by sending a PCW signal
to the device.

  * an electric motor is built with a specific torque and speed
  * use a gearbox to choose desired ratio between torque and speed: more torque, less speed
  * a servo can be also defined by it's rotation: 360, 504, 663, 840, 1260, or continuous. 360 is a single rotation.
  * control: speed, position, both
  * use a gearbox to choose blend of rotation, torque, speed
