Contributors to tooth decay
  * Lack of minerals in the diet (calcium deficiency, magnesium deficiency and phosphorus deficiency)
  * Lack of fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K, especially vitamin D deficiency)
  * Too much consumption of phytic acid-rich foods
  * Too much consumption of processed sugar

How to Reverse Cavities Naturally

== Remove Sugar ==

Probably the worst culprit of them all for anyone who desires healthy, cavity-free teeth, sugar should be avoided like the plague. So kick that sugar addiction stat. Not only does sugar feed oral bacteria that prevents a healthy flow of dental fluids, but it’s highly acidic and can literally decalcify or demineralize the structural content of teeth that create dental decay.

This means staying away from soda, candy and baked goods with sugar. Additionally, use raw honey and maple syrup, and drink juices sparingly, as too much sugar can contribute to cavity formation. Be careful of artificial sweeteners because of their health risks as well. Bottom line: Make stevia your new best friend along with raw honey in moderation!

== Eliminate Phytic Acid ==

Phytic acid (phytate) is a mineral blocker and enzyme inhibitor found in grains, nuts, seeds and beans that can cause serious health problems in our diets. The main reason phytic acid has become an issue today is because we have stopped ancient food preparation techniques, such as sprouting or sourdough fermentation, which kills off the phytic acid.

According to research published in the The Lancet, a diet high in phytic acid creates mineral deficiencies and causes osteoporosis. About 80 percent of phosphorus in grains and beans is bound to phytic acid so it’s completely unabsorbable. In addition to blocking phosphorus availability in humans, these molecules bind minerals necessary for oral health, such as calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc — thus causing them to be unavailable for proper utilization. Consuming foods high in phytic acid decreases magnesium absorption by 60 percent and zinc by 20 percent.

Phytic acid not only prevents you from absorbing minerals in your food, but it also leaches minerals out of your body, bones and teeth!

Subsequently, the powerful anti-nutritional effects of phytic acid have been known to cause digestive disorders, lack of appetite, nutrient deficiencies and tooth decay. A good rule of thumb is to limit your grain consumption and stay completely clear from unfermented soy products.

Because phytic acid is much higher in foods grown using modern high-phosphate fertilizers than those grown in natural compost, try to only eat foods that are organic and GMO-free.

If you’re aiming to improve your health and reverse cavities naturally, foods high in phytic acid like grains, beans, nuts and soy should be avoided. However, if you soak grains or nuts and then sprout them or do sourdough fermentation, you can reduce phytic acid by around 50 percent to 100 percent.

== Consume Raw Dairy and Nutrient-Rich Foods ==

Raw dairy is filled with the vitamins and minerals that contribute to a healthy dental fluid flow and help maintain strong teeth and promote oral wellness. Thus, it’s a great way to get cavity-free teeth. Loaded with calcium, vitamin K2, vitamin D3, magnesium, phosphorus and fat-soluble vitamins, it’s a good idea to consume raw dairy products at least weekly. I recommend goat milk kefir, raw cheeses and organic grass-fed butter as great options.

Remember, if you’re going to beat tooth decay, you need to increase your fat-soluble vitamin intake and mineral intake. If I were creating an ideal diet to follow, it would look like this:

  * Rich in animal foods like bone broth, meat, fish and eggs.
  * Raw and cooked vegetables, especially green leafy vegetables.
  * Raw dairy like kefir, cheese and grass-fed butter.
  * Fruit, one piece daily early in day.
  * Vitamin D — get plenty of sunshine, and days not in sun supplement with 5,000IU daily of D3.
  * Foods high in healthy fats like coconut oil, avocado, olives, and fish or fermented cod liver oil.
  * Fermented grains only and in moderation, such as true sourdough bread (or even better no grains at all). You can buy raw flours and breads.
  * Nuts, seeds and beans only that have been sprouted.
  * Finally, NO processed foods, packaged foods or fast food.

== Use Mineralizing Toothpaste ==

First of all, I know it can get expensive, but there are several brands of fluoride-free toothpaste that you won’t have to pay a small fortune to get your hands on. Second, if you’re looking to save a buck or two and also want to remineralize your teeth in a particularly powerful way, try making your own

Homemade Remineralizing Toothpaste:

  * 4 tablespoons coconut oil
  * 2 tablespoons baking soda (aluminum-free)
  * 1 tablespoon xylitol or 1/8 teaspoon stevia
  * 20 drops peppermint or clove essential oil
  * 20 drops trace  minerals or (calcium/magnesium powder)

== Oil Pulling ==

Used for centuries by Ayurvedic medicine, oil pulling is a fantastic oral detoxification procedure that has gained some popularity in the U.S. the last several years. Simply done by swishing a tablespoon of oil in your mouth for 20 minutes, this simple oral de

If you can’t do 20 minut

  * Spit the spent oil in the trash rather than into the sink, as an accumulation of oil could pose problems for household plumbing down the road.
  * Immediately afterward, rinse your mouth out with warm water. Use salt water for added antimicrobial properties.
