====== Piloting ======

the current method works when steering_angle is 0

when steering is <> 0, then heading is changing (as well as position)

first calc the new heading

then calc the new position (already done)

treat steering_angle as a bearing, that is, an angle in degrees, add it to the previous heading to get the new heading

  * lastKnownHeading + steering_angle = newHeading

  * heading = orientation of the vehicle 

  * heading+helm = prediction of future course

  * course = actual travel = line from previous position to current position

  * simmode = precise
    * heading is set instantly to what we want we want it to be 
    * line: heading = course, line from prevpos to current positon
    * arc: heading is assumed to be perpendicular to the ray from cone to current position
    * both: on nextleg, heading jumps to next leg from
    * no drift 

  * simmode = helmed
    * heading is what it is 
    * course is what it is 
    * set helm bring course back to what we want          
    * includes drift 

  * when we reach a cone
    * change bearing to next cone
    * set helm to steer a circle - how to calculate this based on radius and speed?
    * stay in the circle until heading = bearing
