====== Acid, Base, Salt ======

Base = Alkali or Alkaline

^ Acid             ^  Neutral ^ Base              ^
| pH < 7           |  pH = 7  | pH > 7            |
| turns litmus red |          | turns litmus blue |
| $\ce{H+}$ ions   |          | $\ce{OH-}$ ions   |
| sour taste       |          | bitter taste      | 
| sticky           |          | slippery          |
| proton donor     |          | proton acceptor   |

proton = hydrogen anion $\ce{H+}$

However, they have this low pH values since acids give high amounts of H+ ions to the aqueous solution and pH is the logarithm of the inverse of H+ concentration

===== Acid =====

Two definitions
  * Bronsted-Lowry
  * Lewis

hydrochloric acid

hydrogen having a covalent bond with chlorine

water can act as acid or as base

conjugate base

conjugate acid

Two types:
  * a moledule capable of donating a proton
  * a molecule capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair

Characteristics:


Common acids:
  * carbonated water
  * aspirin
  * hydrochloric acid
  * citric acid



===== Base =====

==== Lime: acid or base? ====

Lime juice squeezed from the fruit is an acid.  A citric acid.  Drinking water infused with lime juice might be referred to as "lime water" (two words).

Lime, a white powder made from pulverized limestone, is a base.  It is usually composed of calcium oxide $\ce{CaO}$ and/or calcium hydroxide $\ce{Ca(OH)2}$.  It is used in agriculture and construction and is sometimes sold commercially as "barn lime", "quick lime", or "garden lime".  Limewater (one word) is the common name for a saturated aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide $\ce{Ca(OH)2}$.

===== Salt =====

A chemical compound consisting of an ionic assembly of cations and anions.



$\ce{NaCl}$  sodium chloride

$\ce{Na}$  sodium

$\ce{Cl}$  chlorine

$\ce{Cl}$  chlorine is the element with atomic number 17, in period 3 with 1 electron short of argon.

$\ce{Cl-}$  chloride is the negative ion of chlorine with one extra electron added, 
when joined to another element in a compound

$\ce{NaCl}$  sodium chloride
$\ce{KCl}$  potassium chloride
$\ce{CaCl}$  calcium chloride
